# MailTape - V2 ✨

Here we go, 10 years after our initial commit on [our first version](https://github.com/MailTape/MailTape.github.io/) built with Jekyll (thanks Github-pages for everything!), our website is on for a new cycle.

After many speculations and headaches about which direction to follow and framework to choose, we decided to roll with Astro. 💫 We keep the good ol' static gen recipe but give it a boost!

Features are the same, all that's been done for the moment is moving from Jekyll to Astro while making sure we keep the same experience. And that was already quiet an adventure. Next step is of course refactoring many stuff to make it cleaner, the component way yay. And then, we'll be ready to invent new cool stuff. ✌️

With love,
MT Crew

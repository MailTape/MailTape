This morning we welcome London-based Qwalia for a very special Sunday selection. 

## Bernard Woma - Fufu

Qwalia: **"** This music is incredibly powerful to me. I have no idea what is going on but it conjures up a deep feeling of joy and some sort of cathartic release for me. I love the sense of momentum and flow despite finding it difficult to follow a conventional pulse. This music reminds me that whatever ideas I have about what something needs to be, maybe it doesn't! **"** 

## Unknown to Known - Negotiations

Qwalia: **"** This is a track by a band which similarly to Qwalia, completely improvised music. I love the more acoustic and earthy sound of this band and the interplay between all the musicians. Their album Lightship came out towards the end of last year and it is worth checking out if you are into nostalgic and cinematic music which avoids sounding too cliche! **"** 

## Georgia Duncan - Mud Slick & Feather

Qwalia: **"** Georgia Duncan is a singer song writer who's music i love. I am so excited that her album is due to be released later this year. This is the first single from the album to come and it features a lovely small choir of singers who create a beautiful lush palette and sound scape. The rest of the music on the album is supported by a more traditional rhythm section, but this track really sets the tone of Georgia's musical aesthetic and what is to come. **"**

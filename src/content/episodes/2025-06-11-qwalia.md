This morning we are delighted to welcome London-based Qwalia for a very special Sunday MailTape selection. The quartet formed from the London jazz scene, featuring Ben Reed on bass (Frank Ocean, David Byrne, Richard Russellâ€™s Everything Is Recorded), Tal Janes on guitar (Jordan Rakei, Cherise, Waaju) Joseph Costi on keys and synths (Cat Stevens, Tom Herbert, Heidi Vogel), and headed by Yusuf Ahmed on drums (Joy Crookes, Unknown to Known). Flowing freely from trance rhythms to spiking solo sections, Qwalia folds jazz, funk, ambient, and psychedelic textures all into one. Each release is a product of improvisation between band members, with tracks recorded live to tape.

Qwalia: **"** This music is incredibly powerful to me. I have no idea what is going on but it conjures up a deep feeling of joy and some sort of cathartic release for me. I love the sense of momentum and flow despite finding it difficult to follow a conventional pulse. This music reminds me that whatever ideas I have about what something needs to be, maybe it doesn't! **"** 

## [Unknown to Known](https://mapsforgettinglost.bandcamp.com/album/lightship) - Negotiations

Qwalia: **"** This is a track by a band which similarly to Qwalia, completely improvised music. I love the more acoustic and earthy sound of this band and the interplay between all the musicians. Their album Lightship came out towards the end of last year and it is worth checking out if you are into nostalgic and cinematic music which avoids sounding too cliche! **"** 

## [Georgia Duncan](https://www.georgiaduncan.co.uk/) - Mud Slick & Feather

Qwalia: **"** Georgia Duncan is a singer song writer who's music i love. I am so excited that her album is due to be released later this year. This is the first single from the album to come and it features a lovely small choir of singers who create a beautiful lush palette and sound scape. The rest of the music on the album is supported by a more traditional rhythm section, but this track really sets the tone of Georgia's musical aesthetic and what is to come. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Qwalia](https://qwalia.bandcamp.com/) - Elevator Company (Live)

 Sarah: **"** Smooooth moving for this Sunday :) This track is the latest release from Qwalia, a rare re-recording of Elevator Company (featured as a single in 2024 and then on the Abbreviations album). Recorded live to tape as always, the track is rich with pockets of swift surprises. Drawing us awake and into its dance ever so gently, the guitar cascades into these crisp percussives, the bass bubbling over and under these textures, shrouded by such silky vocals from Miryam Solomon. **"** 

## [Yishak Banjaw](https://terangabeat.bandcamp.com/album/love-songs-vol-2) - Segno Sra Allebign

 Sarah: **"** Fascinated by this 1986 album from Eritrean musician Yishak Banjaw, who recorded all keys live to tape using a Casio PT. Something playful about this choice, as Banjaw described the instrument proudly as a 'keyboard for kids.' There's some spritelike quality to these melodies, but then the Casio also gives such a cosmic texture to the track, shaping these traditional Eritrean and Ethiopian sounds into spirals. **"** 

## [Qwalia](https://qwalia.bandcamp.com/) - Sound & Reason

Sarah: **"** Another track from Qwalia, this one [the namesake of their 2023 album](https://qwalia.bandcamp.com/album/sound-reason-2). The kicks drive the momentum straight away, but there's something unexpected about these expansive, organ-like synths, lifted by these upending swirls of bass. Look out for the moments of horn section (Idris Rahman, Robin Hopcraft) and this lovely guitar solo section toward the track's end :) **"** 

## Lawne - Beta Pan

 Sarah: **"** One more cosmic jazz pick to close out our Sunday, I hope it keeps you dreaming :) These slow loops through velvety vocals and shimmering synth work are almost dizzying. Love how gently they guide us from the haze into the track's second breath -- time to dance :) **"**

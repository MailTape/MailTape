This morning... 

# Guest's selection

## Timber Timbre - Black Water

Sami: **"** Perfect waking up song, it is to me the reconstruction of a sparkling and lightfull world after a destroying storm. I think the song can make anybody feel like flying over any negative thoughts. The song draws a space of softness and positivity, which is often advisable on a Sunday Morning! **"** 

## Cheba Fadela & Cheb Sahraoui - Manich Mena

Sami: **"** This is a dialogue between two lovers. Both Algerians, they write raï love songs. Fun fact: They're actually a couple! They had the habit of recording one take at the studio. It is a simple structured but so beautiful piece, simplicity and repetition being the thing I love about the song. **"**

## Mashrou' Leila - Radio Romance

Sami: **"** A love song too. Mashrou' Leila has been one of the most influent indie rock band in the Arab world. Beirut-based, they are also representing the gay community, which hasn't been an advantage to them. Speaking of a love relation with melancholy, the singer is using metaphors between the body and the mind. The bridge's construction is simply delicious. **"**

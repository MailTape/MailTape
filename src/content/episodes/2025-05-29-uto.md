This morning, we’re really excited to share a vibrant and joyful selection we’ve put together with UTO. In a world torn apart by vectofascists*, honoring your art is such a brave act of resistance. It’s essential to keep the light shining and push back against that heavy, oppressive veil that tries to dim our creativity and freedom. Let’s keep the spirit alive and support each other!

\* cf Gregory Chatonsky's essay about [vectofascism](https://danslesalgorithmes.net/2025/03/25/vectofascisme/).

# UTO's selection

## [Clarissa Connelly](https://clarissaconnelly.bandcamp.com/track/give-it-back) - Give it back

UTO: **"** It starts with pizzicato acoustic instruments like when we used to play  the Sims in 2001 while dressing avatars in the shopping section. 

Since day one this amazing  Scottish pixie has added  an intemporal touch to the Warp records catalogue, mesmerizing me and I wouldn't be surprised if Joni Mitchell and Aphex Twin shared my crush.

In her unique, soulful and melodic,  song-writing style, piano, strings, violins, drums and flutes dance to Celtic rhythms. Between 2 episodes of Black Mirror it's comforting to look toward the sea, the forest, the menhirs and to imagine that "the love that has come for me is never lost, like the sea won't empty". **"** 

## [Good sad happy bad](https://good-sad-happy-bad.bandcamp.com/track/diy-2) - DIY

UTO: **"** lt's Sunday morning so everything is still possible, today you could just do it yourself because you know how to fix things. This song will give you the power to compile your own weekend to-do list; fixing that squeaky hinge, the wonky shelf, the broken curtain rail, the leaky pipe...

But you don't have to do anything, you can also just stay in bed because CJ Calderwood, Marc Pell, Mica Levi et Raisa Khan will repair your broken down world while you listen to them doing it, all by themselves. **"** 

## [Laura Rivers (arrangement Hakan Hellström)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R3FefV1o2g) - That’s all right

UTO: **"** It's always reassuring to tell yourself "that’s all right", even on a Sunday morning. The song is originally an a cappella recording of a gospel singer named Laura Rivers.

This Swedish producer Hakan Hellström has written a string arrangement for it, which makes it softer, sweeter and even more beautiful, if that is possible. **"** 

# ImaCrea's selection

## [UTO](https://musicuto.bandcamp.com/) - White Flag (dido cover)

 ImaCrea: **"** There’s a sensible nostalgia in rediscovering this cult Dido track that caressed an entire generation in a nascent new millennium full of promises. The uniqueness of a cover is that it serves as an excellent revelator of the style of its interpreter. UTO reinvents this classic with a vibrant melancholia that reverberates majestically 20 years after the original. For the other side of UTO, a shiny and groovy one, look for 'Unshape' curated in [episode 555](https://www.mailta.pe/555/claude/) with Claude as guest. **"** 

## [Joshua Idehen](https://joshuaidehen.bandcamp.com/) - This World's A Madness

ImaCrea: **"** Don't let it get you down, because we need you. Till we stand up, there's hope for peace. Let's keep sharing the love. **"** 

## [Arp Frique & The Perpetual Singers](https://arpfrique.bandcamp.com/track/elena-2) - Elena

 ImaCrea: **"** Dance. Dance. Dance. Keep life pumping in and let anxiety evaporate. **"** 

## [64controll](https://64controll.bandcamp.com/album/bunbun-chopper-ep) - Bunbun Chopper

 ImaCrea: **"** Still not dancing? Tired? Here's your vitamin shot, straight from Japan. **"** 

And that's pretty much it! Thank very much to [UTO](https://musicuto.bandcamp.com/) for their joyful selection and energetic music. Go see them live! Big up to Thibault for the stunning and trippy illustration. See you next week <3

This morning, we will continue to dream gently with our guest [Audrey Carmes](https://audreycarmes.bandcamp.com/album/quelque-chose-sest-dissip). Let's embark on an ambient journey to ethereal lands where music takes us on an inner voyage. Let the soothing melodies guide us through a realm of tranquility and introspection, as we explore the depths of our imagination together.

# Guest's selection

## [Ana Roxanne](https://anaroxanne.bandcamp.com/album/because-of-a-flower-2) - Suite pour l'invisible

Audrey Carmes : **"** I identify a lot with ana roxanne's musical choices, she's a musician who has inspired me a lot and motivated me to go down the path I was starting to take. This track combines everything I love about her work: a gentle drone, a minimal repetitive bass pattern and a spellbinding voice that gradually emerges. All her music is a beautiful balm.**"** 

## [Ruth Goller](https://ruthgoller.bandcamp.com/album/skylla) - Often they came to visit, even just to see how she was (M1)

Audrey Carmes : **"** I've even forgotten how I came across Ruth Goller's music, and it's precisely this piece that has continued to obsess me for several months now. I really admire this use of voice and bass guitar, so spare but so rich in harmony, so free and yet so precise. **"** 

## [Takako Minekawa & Dustin Wong](https://dustinwong.bandcamp.com/album/toropical-circle) - Party on a Floating Cake

Audrey Carmes : **"** I find the music of Takako Minekawa & Dustin Wong is so touching. It makes me want to play with my 80s Casiotone again. It is minimal, experimental, very playful and sincere. This track in particular does me a lot of good, it's simple and full of joy. **"** 

# MailTape's selection

## [Audrey Carmes](https://audreycarmes.bandcamp.com/album/quelque-chose-sest-dissip) - Une Recherche

 ImaCrea : **"** I discovered Audrey Carmes in Aja's selection, whom I had the pleasure of inviting a few weeks ago. Since then, I have been continuously listening to her album. Audrey Carmes has paved a new path, a new sensitivity in ambient music, and I am very excited to listen to what comes next. I chose this track for its progression and its title, which I must say resonates with me a lot. **"** 

## [Madalyn Merkey](https://madalynmerkey.bandcamp.com/album/puzzle-music) - Hairspring

 ImaCrea: **"** A different sensitivity, drawing from the organic and chaotic nature of small things. Madalyn Merker, or how to make synthesizers sing like blackbirds in spring. **"** 

## [Árni Grétar](https://moatun7.bandcamp.com/track/h-f-adalur) - Höfðadalur

 ImaCrea: **"** An enchanted odyssey that begins with drums reminiscent of Boards of Canada, then soars to other lands, with a voice in a language that seems spiritual, grounding us back at the end. A delightful surprise, this recent discovery I made. **"** 

## [Billie Eilish](https://store.billieeilish.com/) - Chihiro

 ImaCrea: **"** In this track recently revealed by Billie Eilish, I sense something so emblematic of our era. While it may be mainstream, there is a unique quality to this song and such a coherent progression at the end of this lineup that I couldn't resist. **"** 

That’s it for this morning, thank you for joining us! Much love to [Audrey Carmes](https://audreycarmes.bandcamp.com/album/quelque-chose-sest-dissip) for her dreamy selection and to Patricia for her inspiring illustration.

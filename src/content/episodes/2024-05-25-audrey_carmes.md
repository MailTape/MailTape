This morning... 

# Guest's selection

## Ana Roxanne - Suite pour l'invisible

Audrey Carmes : **"** I identify a lot with ana roxanne's musical choices, she's a musician who has inspired me a lot and motivated me to go down the path I was starting to take. This track combines everything I love about her work: a gentle drone, a minimal repetitive bass pattern and a spellbinding voice that gradually emerges. All her music is a beautiful balm.**"** 

## Ruth Goller - Often they came to visit, even just to see how she was (M1)

Audrey Carmes : **"** I've even forgotten how I came across Ruth Goller's music, and it's precisely this piece that has continued to obsess me for several months now. I really admire this use of voice and bass guitar, so spare but so rich in harmony, so free and yet so precise. **"** 

## Takako Minekawa & Dustin Wong - Party on a Floating Cake

Audrey Carmes : **"** I find the music of Takako Minekawa & Dustin Wong is so touching. It makes me want to play with my 80s Casiotone again. It is minimal, experimental, very playful and sincere. This track in particular does me a lot of good, it's simple and full of joy. **"**

This morning... 

# Guest's selection

Ola Szmidt : " I wanted to share three songs that have left a deep imprint on me. Each one discovered for the first time while on a train, over different years. These pieces carry the energies of changing weather and shifting emotions. For me, weather is sacred, it’s tied to sound, memory, and the creative process. Here’s a glimpse into the music that continues to shape and inspire me. "

## The Staple Singers - Uncloudy Day

Ola Szmidt: **"** Written by J.K. Alwood | Album: Uncloudy Day (1959).

This one feels like summer. I first heard it after a magical first date, on a train ride home. The warmth of that moment is woven into every note. It’s raw, honest, and deeply soulful, and it still inspires me to this day. **"** 

## Flora Purim - Open Your Eyes You Can Fly

Ola Szmidt: **"** Written by Chick Corea & Neville Potter | Album: Open Your Eyes You Can Fly (1976)

My ultimate cheer-up tune. Whenever someone messages me saying they’re not feeling well, I send them this. Flora’s voice is pure healing, and the production is otherworldly. I discovered her voice through Chick Corea’s Return to Forever, and both remain constant sources of inspiration. **"** 

## Gary Burton Quartet feat. Eberhard Weber - B & G (Midwestern Night’s Dream)

Ola Szmidt: **"** Composed by Michael Gibbs from the album: Passengers (1977).

Where do I even begin? I’ve listened to this track more than 23 times in one sitting on a recent train from Warsaw to my hometown, Włocławek. Eberhard Weber’s bass speaks to my soul; it’s my favorite instrument of all time. The interplay among musicians, the solos, the vibraphone, the mixing. It's  all divine. This track defines musical perfection for me **"**

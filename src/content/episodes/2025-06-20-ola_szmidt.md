 This morning... 

# Guest's selection

Ola Szmidt : " I wanted to share three songs that have left a deep imprint on me. Each one discovered for the first time while on a train, over different years. These pieces carry the energies of changing weather and shifting emotions. For me, weather is sacred, it’s tied to sound, memory, and the creative process. Here’s a glimpse into the music that continues to shape and inspire me. "

## The Staple Singers - Uncloudy Day

Ola Szmidt: **"** Written by J.K. Alwood | Album: Uncloudy Day (1959).

This one feels like summer. I first heard it after a magical first date, on a train ride home. The warmth of that moment is woven into every note. It’s raw, honest, and deeply soulful, and it still inspires me to this day. **"** 

## Flora Purim - Open Your Eyes You Can Fly

Ola Szmidt: **"** Written by Chick Corea & Neville Potter | Album: Open Your Eyes You Can Fly (1976)

My ultimate cheer-up tune. Whenever someone messages me saying they’re not feeling well, I send them this. Flora’s voice is pure healing, and the production is otherworldly. I discovered her voice through Chick Corea’s Return to Forever, and both remain constant sources of inspiration. **"** 

## Gary Burton Quartet feat. Eberhard Weber - B & G (Midwestern Night’s Dream)

Ola Szmidt: **"** Composed by Michael Gibbs from the album: Passengers (1977).

Where do I even begin? I’ve listened to this track more than 23 times in one sitting on a recent train from Warsaw to my hometown, Włocławek. Eberhard Weber’s bass speaks to my soul; it’s my favorite instrument of all time. The interplay among musicians, the solos, the vibraphone, the mixing. It's  all divine. This track defines musical perfection for me **"** 

# Curator's selection

## Ola Szmidt - Stillness

ImaCrea: **"** "Room to dream", the album containing this track, was released in February and it became rapidly to me the soundtrack to accompany the metamorphosis from winter to spring. I was familiar with Ola Szmidt's work but this time the environment, setting and consciousness of the moment made it click in a new way. I can't recall how many times I've listen to this track, the balance it incorporates is so subtle and gentle. There is also great fragility and generosity hearing her voice that inspires me to create also gentle and caring creations. This precision opens a door towards inner humane feeling only real care and love can produce and it so important especially in our difficult times. Thank you Ola.**"** 

## Hiroshi Yoshimura - 水のささやき \[Humming Water]

ImaCrea: **"** I discovered Hiroshi Yoshimura's work only recently, thanks to my lover who encountered his music at an art exhibition. The enveloping and reassuring sound of the water flowing reminds me about what I read recently in "Futur Ancestral" by Ailton Krenak. The river is everywhere we've been. In every city centre, there's water near. But he warns us how modern society have became blind to the river, exploiting her and suffocating her. But as we loose this sensitivity we might as well loose our humanity. This track from Hiroshi encapsulate somehow a similar image to me, the river we listen to is not just a 'sound record' its the river chanting and making music. The rest is only surrunding, she's the goddess of the track. "

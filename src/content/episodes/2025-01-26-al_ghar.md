This morning we slept poorly again. Many of us have disturbed sleep
from reading about what's happening in the world, especially in the
US. But if you follow us, you should know we're not the type to give
up. Resistance is being organized, everywhere, starting with our
musical listening. Our fight is to share every week the work of
artists who escape the great march of the world, who show us other
paths to dream, to flourish, to have fun and to struggle, always.

Our guest of the day
is exactly in this vibe. You may have heard her wacky lyrics on the
mic for [Polylogue from Syla](https://www.takeiteasyagency.com/labelartist/polylogue-from-sila/), her wild energy behind the drums of
[Parcours Santé](https://soundcloud.com/parcours-sante/sets/compte-commun?ref=clipboard&p=i&c=1&si=EC96AE4610CE4EE5A58789C7D77A53F5&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) or the sweetness of her voice when she sang with [The
Bongo Hop](https://thebongohop.bandcamp.com/music), but this time, it's with a (almost) solo project that she
takes us on today.\
If Al Ghar is now a
duo — thanks to the delicious touch of Neige Arnaud — it's above
all from the pulse of Laurène Pierre-Magnani that the formation saw
the light of day. She prepared a selection to her image, powerful,
committed and electric! Tracks that form tibutes to freedom,
empowerment and life pleasures that no one can deny us.

# Al Ghar's selection

## [Cocanha](https://cocanha.bandcamp.com/) - Cotelon

Al Ghar: **"** Cocanha is strength and softness at the same time. This mix of
tradition and renewal fascinates me. In this piece in particular,
they work their voices like instrumentalists, with breath, little
cries, on repetitive patterns and dissonant and light harmonies.
Besides, making everyone dance with this simple voice/percussion is
really classy. These three girls (then two) have a universe that is
discreetly militant, feminist with a proud of their country but very
open to the world, and you hear it. **"** 

## [Mouvman Alé](https://mouvman-ale.bandcamp.com/) - Sokouyé Marmay

Al Ghar: **"**On stage, it was the biggest slap in the face of my last year. There is a wizard who screams and carries you away, some burning maloya, synthetic bass that drives you crazy, stratospheric guitar flights and trance throughout. It's a tidal wave. Once again, what fascinates me is this tradition that the young generation is taking over and taking further; the drums roll side by side with the big synths which merge, led by texts in Creole which are often very poetic. The slap.**"** 

## [Dope St Jude](https://www.dopesaintjude.com/) - Alphas

 Al Ghar: **"** It's hard to separate Dope St Jude's sound from what she represents: she's a black lesbian, whose music videos are often odes to queerness and diversity. Necessary. It turns out that what's moreover, her flow is poisonous, her lyrics electrifying and her productions impeccably polished. Often very minimal, with super deep bass and ultra effective drops. You can't resist the urge to move your butt. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Al Ghar](https://www.alghar-musique.com/) – Châtelet

 Anto: **"**This piece is a small capture of a live performance during a local radio show. It’s all simple and yet it gives you something else to hear. For me it’s a beautiful definition of what a song is. Because if anyone can produce a sound, you necessarily have to add a little extra soul to make it melodious and to express something. Here I hear a sound that comes from the guts, almost literally. This is the first extract from the Al Ghar project, like giving birth after long years of work, the delivery of a beautiful baby, born to shine, fruit of multiple origins, who develops a singular personality and enriches himself of his many encounters. Recently, Neige Arnaud, musician from the groups [Ohm](https://ohmelectricpowertrio.bandcamp.com/) and [Queen Willow](https://linktw.in/GXquqC), joined the adventure, and Al Ghar is growing. Can’t wait to hear what’s next! **"** 

## [Flor Mata](https://flormata.bandcamp.com/music) – Tears

 Anto: **"** What can you do when you suffer the ouins-ouins (sobs) of the dominant classes, because you have the audacity to free yourself from gender, origins or religion? Well, you can collect their tears and bathe in them. This is what Flor Mata does, by describing how in this song, with this captivating bass and these crying that we laugh, which form a refrain that sticks to the brain, which can then be drawn at any time, as soon as an oppressor complains about people who are too "woke”...\
The multifaceted artist is also featured in [Extravaganza](https://www.instagram.com/extravaganzaparis/), an incredible Parisian cabaret that combines several live performances, dance, theater, drag show, acrobatics, etc. Breathtaking show to see **"** 

## [Popimane trio](https://popimane.bandcamp.com/music) - Angné mounké

 Anto: **"** Popimane trio is the extension of Dramane Dembele's solo project, but with two other musicians, you know... On this track he's accompanied by Mathilde Tirard on keyboards and Alexis Hontondji on percussion and vocals for the rapped text at the end of the song Everything else, the Fulani flute, the voice, the goni, is played by Popimane. In the end, we obtain a joyful mix of African and electronic music and a mystical atmosphere, quite heavy, particularly catchy. The ending text, in French, gives it a slightly more contemporary anchor by denouncing the colonial heritage of the Global North, which continue to cause suffering and injustice throughout the world.  **"** 

## [Tshegue](https://www.instagram.com/tshegue_official/) – Shuffle

 Anto: **"** We end with the afro-rock group Tshegue who released a new EP a few weeks ago which is still very exciting. I say "afro-rock" because despite a certain marketing tendency to attach the term afro to all musical genres as soon as there are exotic sounds (we don't forget that rock exists thanks to the genius of black musicians from the 50s), Tshegue managed a rare mix, which is far from the nice rhythms that we like to find in world music. With Tshegue it’s violent, it’s punk, it’s angry, it gives fever and it puts us in a trance.  **"** 

That's all for this week's episode, the rest is happening in concert halls near you and in alternative places that encourage artistic creation. Support your artists, go see them live, even if it’s winter ;)

Thank you Marie for the illustration, and thank you Laurène for the inspiring selection.

Hasta la victoria siempre!

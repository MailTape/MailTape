  This morning we're playing jazz! And to be more precise, we offer you

  a journey around the saxophone, this instrument whose vibration is

  unique, sometimes mystical and often the source of a certain

  enchantment. If you're not familiar, we found the perfect guide for

  you: Muriel Grossman. She is a specialist in the domain, and she’s

  about to release a highly anticipated new album.


  Accompanied by her quartet, Muriel explores the world of spiritual jazz and offers a sixteenth album, the result of slow maturation, resolutely full of a joy that she enjoys sharing wherever she has the pleasure to play.

This morning we're playing jazz! And to be more precise, we offer you
a journey around the saxophone, this instrument whose vibration is
unique, sometimes mystical and often the source of a certain
enchantment. If you're not familiar, we found the perfect guide for
you: [Muriel Grossman](https://murielgrossmann.bandcamp.com/). She is a specialist in the domain, and she’s
about to release a highly anticipated new album (which is also being
listened to collectively for the first time [this evening](https://murielgrossmann.bandcamp.com/merch/the-light-of-the-mind-listening-party-with-the-full-band)).

Accompanied by her
quartet, Muriel explores the world of spiritual jazz and offers a
sixteenth album, the result of slow maturation, resolutely full of a
joy that she enjoys sharing wherever she has the pleasure to play. 

So plug in your best
sound system and listen to how this selection resonates, as profound
as it is unexpected, where playful melodies and textures intertwine,
each more unique than the last. 

# Guest's selection

## [Dexter Gordon](https://storyvillerecords.bandcamp.com/) - Ca'Purange

Muriel Grossman: "Ca'Purage" ... incredible song and performance by Dexter and the crew, digging deep into soul jazz. It's always nice to hear Dexter, he always plays great and some really groovy stuff by
legendary drummer Louis Haynes, who is still alive by the way, call
him for your show too.

## [Cannonball Adderley](https://cannonballadderley.bandcamp.com/) - 74 Miles Away

 Muriel Grossman: Great composition by Joe Zawinul and a classic performance by this great band. Spiritual jazz crossed with some soulful playing, as usual with the Cannonball groups, this selection is also recorded live ... 1967, a transitional year, lots of great records, lot's of great music!

## [Wayne Shorter](https://wayneshorter.bandcamp.com) - Wind

 Muriel Grossman: "Odyssey of Iska" is a great record by Wayne Shorter, one of my favorites, it was just after he left the Miles band and before
he and Zawinul formed Weather Report ... it's a great avant-garde
record, unknown, underrated...

# Curator's selection

## [Muriel Grossman](https://murielgrossmann.bandcamp.com/) - Unison Unveiled

 Anto: **"** I must admit that my jazz culture is very limited. I let my ears
wander here and there, randomly on a few musical wanderings, and I
delight in a few nuggets that are accessible to me or that manage to
catch my attention. This is how I came across a composition by Muriel
Grossman one day. And you see, what's magical about music is that
sometimes things happen that can't be explained, there are pieces
that hit the spot, as if they were going to stick somewhere deep
within us, in the place that was naturally intended for them. 
Digging a little deeper, I really appreciated the energy and values ​​that Muriel seeks to convey with her music. It is therefore quite natural that I invited her for this episode, and it is a real pleasure to be able to
offer you a preview of "Unison Unveild", a very bright and
particularly groovy track which will appear on the new album. Enjoy! **"** 

## [Cochemea](https://cochemea.bandcamp.com) -Curandera

 Anto: **"** This track is a step into unknown territory. Visibly sacred land, we feel irremediably good. The sax twirls from one place to another,
never where we might expect it... We follow it and realize its
healing power. As if he were healing something, something different
in each of us. Healer. This is what "Curandera" means in
Spanish.  **"** 

## [Nubya Garcia](https://nubyagarcia.bandcamp.com/) - A Shade Of Jade

 Anto: **"** With this song, Nubya Garcia masterfully shows us how the saxophone is capable of stepping aside to better let his friends shine. She is there, she welcomes everyone and stands back to watch with delight as her mate thrill the audience. Then she comes in turn to swing an incomparable vibe, a poetry delicately placed where it is needed. The end phase where the sax gradually leaves the piece is a delight that we never tire of. **"** 

## [Manu Dibango](https://manudibango.bandcamp.com) - Frozen Soul

 Anto: **"** Finally we finish with an even different rhythm, which smells like the sun (which contrasts radically with the title of the track). Here
Uncle Manu vibrates his instrument with grace and elegance,
delivering a perfect score. It’s the happiness of a ray of sunshine
in the middle of winter, we take it as it is, we welcome it with
pleasure and it rewards us a hundredfold. **"** 

And here it is for this morning selection. Thanks a lot to Camille Celestin for this stunning illustration and thanks again to Muriel: it was so smooth and very nice to cook this episode with her.

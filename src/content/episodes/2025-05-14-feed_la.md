Good morning, good morning, good morning to you ! Today, we are absolutely buzzing to welcome Feed LA to MailTape. Based in Berlin, the band flies freely across experimental jazz, punchy funk, and low rock textures. Leaning into the joy of jazz music and everything in between, their releases are rich in wandering detours and pivoting surprises. Unfurling before our ears, each track invites us to the intricate conversations between players, where every murmur and pause hovers in the air, a joy to discover. The band joins us following the release of their latest single, Feed Lala, promising many more on the way ;-)

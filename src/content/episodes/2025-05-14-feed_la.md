Good morning, good morning, good morning to you ! Today, we are absolutely buzzing to welcome Feed LA to MailTape. Based in Berlin, the band flies freely across experimental jazz, punchy funk, and low rock textures. Leaning into the joy of jazz music and everything in between, their releases are rich in wandering detours and pivoting surprises. Unfurling before our ears, each track invites us to the intricate conversations between players, where every murmur and pause of the bassline, the drums, the trumpet, and the keys hover in the air, a joy to discover. The band joins us following the release of their latest single, Feed Lala, promising many more on the way ;-)

## Feed LA - Track

 Curator: **"** Inventive improvisations and unexpected harmonic textures are Feed LA's signature, and this is ingrained throughout the band's creative process. With Özgür Bayraktar on keys, Daniel Ray Gahn on drums, Michael Treetop Voß on trumpet, and early collaborator Jeff Özdemir on bass, the group cuts each session live to tape -- even from their earliest stages of songwriting. As Özgur describes, these sessions are build on trust in the flow. Often not even glancing at one another, the players move like silk from one groove to the next, threading funk, hip hip, rick, and jazz sounds all into one. 

Listening over these studio tapes, band members become listeners, rediscovering their own improvisations as outsiders. Sifting through hours of first-layer archives, band member Michael describes waiting for his ears to prick up, caught by an unexpected tangle of melody, a knot of harmony, or a flashing rhythm shift. Moments like these become seedlings for the next studio session's exploration. Gradually, these sessions build the band's discography. Even in the final stages of production, the band finds one last moment of creativity. Certain instruments are drawn into sharper focus, background textures embellished, and fresh twists and loops woven into the song's structure. Daniel describes this sonic sculpting as part of the thrill of improvisation, guiding listeners through the conversations between players, pulling them as close as possible to the studio's heartbeat. **"**

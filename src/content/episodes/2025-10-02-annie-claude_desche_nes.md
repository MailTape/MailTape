There's a bit of everything in today's selection: a good dose of Cold Wave, some wacky Electro, a regressive Pop, some Punk style that stains and even a little tropical vibe. Yes yes, it seems completely disjointed said like that and yet, this autumnal MailTape is consistent with the season: full of colors that are a feast for the eyes (or the ears).

It’s [Annie-Claude Deschênes](https://annie-claudedeschenes.bandcamp.com/music) who delights us today. The Montreal artist knows better than anyone how to navigate through troubled atmospheres, sometimes dark and chaotic or on the contrary, deliciously nostalgic and bright. The album [Les manières de Table](https://annie-claudedeschenes.bandcamp.com/album/les-mani-res-de-table) gives us a glimpse of this dangerously magnetizing universe, which is difficult to resist from the moment the first notes resonate. We perceive something a bit worrying that almost makes us want to flee in the opposite direction, but it’s impossible to escape these melodies that grab us, tied us and pull us by force into unknown depths...

# Guest's selection

## [Charlotte Adigéry & Bolis Pupul](https://charlotteandbolis.bandcamp.com/) - HAHA

 Annie-Claude Deschênes: **"**I just loooove this track, it's playful but also really deep. It's mostly Adigéry's laugh on repeat, but somehow it takes you through a whole bunch of emotions, showing just how messy, rich, and human feelings can be. As a composer, it's super inspiring, and it reminds me that you can tackle serious stuff and still have fun with it.**"** 

## [Safe Mind](https://safemind.bandcamp.com/) - 6' Pole

 Annie-Claude Deschênes: **"**61% of my brain is officially stuck on this song, and I'm not even mad. The melodies are super catchy, and I love the mix of laid-back vocals, which have a bit of a no wave vibe, on top of the electronic beats.**"** 

## [Sextile](https://sextile.bandcamp.com/) - Disco

 Annie-Claude Deschênes: **"**Disco is one of my go-to tracks for a DJ set. It always fires up the party and has that D.A.F. vibe, but darker and punkier. It makes me want to create songs with a similar energy that keep the crowd moving.**"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Annie-Claude Deschênes](https://annie-claudedeschenes.bandcamp.com/music) - Ancients

 Anto: **"**Anything that sounds Cold Wave has this fascinating power to instantly immerse me into the sewers of my soul, where my most sordid ideas are evacuated, those that I don't fully assume, that I mechanically hide under several layers of earth... It's the musical style that speaks best to my lower instincts. It's frank and uncontrollable. Here we have a metallic riff that seems to invoke I don't know what supernatural force that has come to suck out our soul. And everything gets out of hand, the rhythm accelerates, Annie-Claude recites prophetic incantations while I pass out. The music causes frenetic jolts that disconnect me from reality. I sink happily into such a familiar darkness...**"** 

## [Paprika Kinski](https://paprikakinski.bandcamp.com/) - Steady Lover

 Anto: **"**This track has been on my playlist for several years. There's something adolescent about this falsely ingenuous Pop. It echoes the pains and joys of the high school years, where anything is possible, also where imagination collides with the brutality of reality. This song is light and innocent, but it’s also expresses something else, a frank and incisive point of view, which dots the i's and crosses the t's. It’s funny to feel like a big relief when the song goes crazy. Golly, this outrageous desire to live beyond a polite way of life is really good to hear!**"** 

## [Holograms](https://holograms.se/) - Stress

 Anto: **"**When will there be a new album from the Swedish band that shook the Punk scene with its angry and explosive sounds? I have fond memories of [their first album](https://hologramsct.bandcamp.com/album/holograms), which made my brain boil. It was like receiving a big friendly slap to wake you up from a stupefying torpor. It shook me. But it did me so much good! A salutary and benevolent violence that changes you permanently...**"** 

## [Alek Lee](https://alekleemusic.bandcamp.com/) - Cold Feet 

 Anto: **"**And to finish, a bit of sweetness with a different wave. "Cold Feet" is the title of this song but it's also that of [an exciting LP](https://alekleemusic.bandcamp.com/album/cold-feet) released a few weeks ago that makes my speakers stir. I don't know if it's a real guitar that propels us into the full sun, carried by the reminiscences of the previous songs, but damn it's effective! The bass adds an irresistible groove, and what about the synth that takes the song into another dimension, where nothing matters...**"** 

 That's all for today friends.\
We warmly thank Annie-Claude Deschènes for her very inspiring selection and we welcome Antoine Gaudin who has graced us with his first inspired illustration.\

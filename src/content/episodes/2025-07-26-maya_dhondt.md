Woohoo, it’s the last episode of season 14 !

To finish on a high note, we invited Maya Dhondt, with whom we prepared a sonic fireworks that we hope will be joyful, intense, and memorable! A beautiful mess made of strange and fascinating sounds. Some unclassifiable melodies, some wild herbs that grow where you least expect them...

That's a good thing, it’s in essence a bit like this that we could characterize Maya Dhondt's music. Her creativity is delirious. She wanders gaily, almost innocently, like a cloud lost in the middle of a blue sky. But sometimes it's the thunder! An ecstatic ruckus that gets out of control. And for this selection, we're embarking on this path.

Ready? Fire!

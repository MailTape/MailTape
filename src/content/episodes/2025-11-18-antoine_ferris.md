This morning... 

# Guest's selection

## Lukas Koenig - Full Mantis (ft. Guilty Simpson)

 Guest: **"** This track comes from drummer Lukas Koenig’s album 1 Above Minus Underground. It’s kind of an experimental hip-hop record, since every track has a different hip-hop guest on it. The whole album is amazing, but I picked this track because of Julien Desprez’s intro, he’s been an endless influence on how I approach music and my instrument. I also feel like this mix of styles is a great gateway into what we call “experimental music.”  I highly recommend checking out Mopcut as well, the group featuring Lukas Koenig, Julien Desprez, and Audrey Chen, as well as Dälek recently. **"** 

## Mariam Rezaei - Going straight (and fucking it up)

 Guest: **"** I’m a very big fan of Mariam Rezaei! Her latest album Fractured is incredible. I love her DJ work and the way she uses samples, something that has recently seeped into my own music. She also has a band with Lukas Koenig called The Sleep Of Reason Produces Monsters. That whole crew is kind of the Avengers of experimental music for me! **"** 

## sús - Além do tempo

 Guest: **"** Here we get another side of me, much more melancholic and more pop. I absolutely love autotune. And I love pop music. Again, I could have picked the whole album, but this song is just so beautiful! sús is one of those artists I never get tired of listening to. **"**

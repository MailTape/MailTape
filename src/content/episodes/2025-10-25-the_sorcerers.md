This morning, MailTape offers you the soundtrack of a thrilling film that could take place somewhere in East Africa, like an Ethiopian Tarantino, with real contemplative shots, incredible action scenes, languid moments... An adventure in 7 chapters, a fabulous journey between gems of a futuristic past and resolutely modern sounds, which draw from varied influences!

This Original Soundtrack, we owe it to the Sorcerers, the band from the north of England who released last July a fourth album, in the line of the previous ones, which offers a groove borrowed from ethio-jazz, where one sees walking sometimes a sax, sometimes a keyboard, sometimes a clarinet, sometimes a guitar... Always a bit freaky, this album has an astral dimension, like an invitation to venture into unknown territory, despite apprehension. Let's embark on this joyful journey made of soundscapes that may take your breath away.

# Guest's selection

## Latin Playboys - Mustard

Magic Tuber Stringband: **"** I just recently discovered the wonders of this little project, which I think I had always discounted because of its name. It's got just about everything - field recordings, lo-fi production, hi-fi production, slick new blues tunes, half-baked fiddle jams, zany synth, glitchy guitar, spoken word, drum machines. No track sounds the same, but "Mustard" is one of my favorites, an infectious experiment in minimalist songwriting. By no means perfect records but that's what makes them trips worth taking. - Evan Morgan (guitar, pump organ) **"** 

## Catherine Ribeiro + Alpes - Âme debout

Magic Tuber Stringband: **"** Another recent discovery, sadly due to Ribeiro's passing this past summer. The ballads are plaintive; Ribeiro's voice is powerful but vulnerable, often venturing into extended techniques; the band sounds like Emmanuelle Parrenin jamming with Tangerine Dream. There's a clear dedication to repetition and texture that I think we always hope to maintain in our own music. - Evan Morgan (guitar, pump organ) **"** 

## Baka Beyond / Baka Forest People - Venolouma

Magic Tuber Stringband: **"** This track more or less has it all for me. Sonically, the three voices (strings, percussion, voice) interact with a dizzying complexity that doesn't obscure the clarity of the whole. Each individual part is characterized by what seems to be strict repetition of motif with the allowance for variation. However, identifying any given motif proves to be difficult at times upon close listening, as the variations between repetitions are significant. I am particularly inspired by a musical approach that can preserve both of these aspects simultaneously, that is, strict repetition without a loss of organic improvisation, or organic improvisation without a loss of motivic thread.
Perhaps most notable, this music feels deeply rooted in and contextualized by the place of its making, as well as the humanity of the specific musicians performing. Though the intricacy of its construction is superlative, it is the emotional response that the music provokes that makes this track stand out to me. - Mike DeVito (bass, banjo) **"**

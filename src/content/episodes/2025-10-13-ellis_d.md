This morning we are electrified to welcome Brighton-based artist ELLiS·D. He comes from behind the drums, where he’s spent years driving the rhythm for different bands, something he still does today. But his solo project steps into its own world, sharp and distinctive. His voice stands out too: not just beautiful, but bent in unexpected ways, captivating.                                                                                 This is a show you won’t want to miss, and he’ll be playing at Supersonic in Paris, on October 24.                His selection carries us through every kind of Sunday mood, a pure bliss from start to finish. We'll shortly be taking a stroll around the 80's before arriving to destination.

Time to take off, let’s see where this ride takes us.

# [ELLiS·D](https://www.ellisdellisd.com/)'s selection

## [Richard Hawley](https://richardhawley.co.uk/) - Coles Corner

ELLiS·D: **"** Could choose almost any Richard Hawley track here, but Coles Corner is my favourite of his incredible discography. A masterclass in hopeful yet doomed romantic crooning from the South Yorkshire Scott Walker **"** 

## [Tom Waits](https://tomwaits.bandcamp.com/) - A Sweet Little Bullet From A Pretty Blue Gun

ELLiS·D: **"** For those Sunday mornings when you over do it on the coffee and want to dance round the kitchen like a sleazy jazz poet. Pairs well with cigs too, unless you're hungover. **"** 

## [Miles Davis](https://milesdavis.bandcamp.com/album/miles-55) - Blue In Green

ELLiS·D: **"** Such a beautiful piece of music, I can sometimes go through around 4-5 different emotional states during the nine and a half minutes of this song. Especially on emotionally susceptible Sunday mornings. Good for getting that out of the way before you hit the pub. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [ELLiS·D](https://ellissd.bandcamp.com/) - Humdrum

 Aloyse: **"** It moves fast, and I love how the voice, drums, and guitar all shake your head as the song goes on. Let’s just jump around please ! **"** 

## [Chrisma](https://spittlerecords.bandcamp.com/album/chinese-restaurant) - Black Silk Stocking

 Aloyse: **"** I just discovered Chrisma (who later became Krisma), a major band from the Italian new wave scene in the late 70s and 80s. Funny thing, first thing i heard this track I actually thought it was new… but it’s from 1977. You’ve got to see them [in motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTsR49YwHAI),  I love how their legs move here. And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZNs66sBgNQ)
the contrast between the super disco-kitsch intro and Chrisma’s weird performance is just perfect. **"** 

## [Denis Leary](https://www.instagram.com/denisleary/?hl=fr) - Love Barge

 Aloyse: **"** The Love Boat having fun on a punk barge, love sung the way we like it. The onboard entertainment is a hypnosis session to stop you from quitting smoking. Inhale, exhale. **"** 

## [The Stevenson Ranch Davidians](https://thedavidians.bandcamp.com/) - Holy Life

 Aloyse: **"** I don’t know why, but listening to the previous tracks in this playlist made me think of this song. I actually discovered it on an Anton Newcombe playlist, one of my favorites. I find it powerful, and perfect to close things off. A conversation, a day, an idea, a playlist. **"** 

As always, thank you for joining us. Big thanks to ELLiS·D for his amazing selection, and to [Noémie](noemirabelle.tumblr.com) for this episode’s beautiful illustration!

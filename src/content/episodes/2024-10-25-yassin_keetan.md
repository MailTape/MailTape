This morning we're delighted to welcome Paris-based music producer [Yassin Keetan](https://www.instagram.com/yassinkeetan/) to MailTape!

Yassin is an emerging artist on the French electronica scene who launched himself in 2023, after several years of experimenting with his instrumental compositions as an amateur. Following the successful releases of a series of singles with sonorities drawing on his French touch, ambient and even rock influences, he is now stepping out with his first EP, <i>[The Warm Presence of the Absent](https://www.diggersfactory.com/fr/vinyl/321728/yassin-keetan-the-warm-presence-of-the-absent)</i>, under the label he co-founded, Waïkey Music. 

# Yassin Keetan's selection




## [Beach House](https://beachhouse.bandcamp.com/) - Space Song



Yassin: **"** This is probably my favorite song ever. I've never been so moved by a song before.  The first time I heard it, I was working on my computer, listening to a random Indie  playlist on YouTube. I was going through a hard time, and the song just hit me. I  stopped, closed my eyes, and really listened. It felt like it was made for me at that  moment. That's how you know a song is special — when it connects with you  emotionally. I can listen to it over and over and never get bored.  **"** 



## Ratatat - I Will Return



Yassin: **"** Ratatat is my dream band. They’re the reason I wanted to start composing music.  What's funny is that it took me a while to realize their tracks are purely  instrumental. Sometimes there's a chorus, but the melodies are always carried by  instruments, especially guitars. That’s when I understood how powerful  instrumental music can be, and when I knew I wanted to include it in my own work.  'I Will Return' is my favorite track from their album <i>Magnifique</i> — I love the slow  tempo and melancholic feel. It’s perfect for a cloudy Sunday morning. I also really  enjoy 'Montanita' from <i>Classics</i>, which is more upbeat but still has those beautiful  melodies.  **"**



## [Glass Beams](https://glassbeams.bandcamp.com/album/mahal) - Orb



Yassin: **"** I came across Glass Beams not too long ago. I’m really into their psychedelic vibe,  blending classical instruments with electronic elements and a groovy bassline. I  also love their aesthetic and the direction they take artistically. I can’t wait to catch  them live. Their whole EP is perfect for a laid-back Sunday afternoon — I could  easily sit back and listen to it on repeat while just chilling. **"** 



# MailTape's selection



## [Yassin Keetan](https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/artist/4dXO04GueTAdrrRvR5q6NK) - Encounter



Jules: **"** Certainly inspired by his training as an actor, which he also puts to good use in his beautifully crafted music videos, Yassin's music creates a visual universe rich in landscapes, imaginations and emotions for the listener. This is the latest release from his EP, which is a heartfelt homage to his late mother, who passed away just before he embarked on his musical journey. Each track, with its sometimes melancholic, sometimes epic melodies, explores themes of loss, healing and remembering loved ones in a different way, painting complex emotions with atmospheric textures. **"** 



## [ddwy](https://ddwy.bandcamp.com/) - Pendorlan



 Jules: **"** This track is taken from the 6th edition of the <i>Chill Pill</i> compilation, released by the Munich-based label [Public Possession](https://publicpossession.bandcamp.com/album/chill-pill-vi), and featuring songs from various artists and friends of the label. Off the beaten path of electronic music, sometimes flirting with pop, rock or hip-hop, this compilation always delivers a relaxing experience - just what you're looking for on a Sunday morning. With this sentimental track, ddwy, the duo made up of [nangi](https://www.instagram.com/nangiiiiiiiii/) and [Inner Totality](https://www.instagram.com/innertotality/), does not disappoint. **"** 



## Total Blue - Jaguarundi



Jules: **"** Another stunning release from my definitely favourite music label, [Music From Memory](https://music-from-memory.bandcamp.com/). Total Blue is the Los Angeles based trio of Nicky Benedek, Alex Talan and Anthony Calonico. Their eponymous debut album was released in July 2024 but draws influences from 80s New Age and ambient jazz. I particularly love this track, with its rainforest rhythms and vaporwave synths. **"** 



## [Ellinor Jackson](https://soundcloud.com/ellinor-jackson) - De Se Trouver



 Jules: **"** An emotional gem of a song from Swedish music producer Ellinor Jackson. It's the kind of sound that you stumble upon while digging for hours, that you listen to with one ear, then immediately play over and over again, that you're excited to share with your music buddies, and that stays in your head for weeks. **"**  



That’s it for this morning, thank you for joining us! Much love to [Yassin Keetan](https://www.instagram.com/yassinkeetan/) for his bliss and moving selection and to [Marie Alléguède](https://mariealleguede.com/) for her sweet illustration, inspired by a photography by [Lisa Miliani](https://lisamiliani.com/)!

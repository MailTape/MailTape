# Yassin Keetan's selection




## Beach House - Space Song



Yassin Keetan: **"** This is probably my favorite song ever. I've never been so moved by a song before.  The first time I heard it, I was working on my computer, listening to a random Indie  playlist on YouTube. I was going through a hard time, and the song just hit me. I  stopped, closed my eyes, and really listened. It felt like it was made for me at that  moment. That's how you know a song is special — when it connects with you  emotionally. I can listen to it over and over and never get bored.  **"** 



## Ratatat - I Will Return



Yassin Keetan: **"** Ratatat is my dream band. They’re the reason I wanted to start composing music.  What's funny is that it took me a while to realize their tracks are purely  instrumental. Sometimes there's a chorus, but the melodies are always carried by  instruments, especially guitars. That’s when I understood how powerful  instrumental music can be, and when I knew I wanted to include it in my own work.  'I Will Return' is my favorite track from their album Magnifique — I love the slow  tempo and melancholic feel. It’s perfect for a cloudy Sunday morning. I also really  enjoy 'Montanita' from Classics, which is more upbeat but still has those beautiful  melodies.  **"**



## Glass Beams - Orb



Yassin Keetan: **"** I came across Glass Beams not too long ago. I’m really into their psychedelic vibe,  blending classical instruments with electronic elements and a groovy bassline. I  also love their aesthetic and the direction they take artistically. I can’t wait to catch  them live. Their whole EP is perfect for a laid-back Sunday afternoon — I could  easily sit back and listen to it on repeat while just chilling. **"**

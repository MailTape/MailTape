Polygonia joins MailTape this morning, gifting us some immersive and infectious textures :) Headed by multi-disciplinary artist Lindsey Wang, Polygonia's releases tread seamlessly between ethereal ambient and deep techno. The Munich-based artist joins us following the release of her latest album, [Dermatology](https://rrose.bandcamp.com/album/dermatology).

# Guest's selection

## [SALOMEA](https://salomeaofficial.com/) - Truth Is Queen, Kindness Is King

 Guest: **"** It’s hard to pick a favourite from this huge album ‘Good Life’ which SALOMEA put out recently. I decided to choose this track as it showcases so well how amazing all musicians of this band are. Rebekka Salomea, the front singer, lyricist and composer, Yannis Anft on Keys, Oliver Lutz on bass and Leif Berger on drums - these four really manage to absolutely impress me each time. Hearing them life is an outstanding almost life changing experience. And with this track and this record in general, they once again proved heir point of real artistry and skill. **"** 

## [Carmen Villain](https://carmenvillain.bandcamp.com/) - Nutrition

 Guest: **"** I love the close intimate feeling of this track. No reverb at all and so wooden, so warm. It’s very minimalistic but with all the right sounds in the right place. A groove which almost feels like a ritualistic sequence. On the one hand, a perfect tool for layering in DJ sets, but also great for home listening. **"** 

## [Jorge Reyes](https://www.discogs.com/artist/14111-Jorge-Reyes?srsltid=AfmBOoqEW9OmUB9EFnBv5rBHLvlxAtr8hr-3naRi6W_P8s3t5T2GtfgF) - El Senor De La Aurora

 Guest: **"** This album ‘The Flayed God’ was a recommendation of a friend with whom I talked about my experiences with indigenous people in Colombia. Its vibe matched these stories so well, that I directly associate the music with all the precious things I’ve learned from this journey. One of my most important focus points in live is my connection to nature. And this album always brings me back to what to be thankful for and reminds me of what to look out for in life. The sounds of nature combined with the ritualistic flutes and rhythms are directly connected to human roots. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Nesa Azadikhah](https://nesaazadikhah.bandcamp.com/), [Polygonia](https://polygonia.bandcamp.com/) - Reverie (Polygonia'S Fantasme Mix)

Sarah: **"** The latest release from Polygonia, just last week :) The energy is contagious with these rich rhythmic webs of sound. Polygonia's exploration of acoustic and synthetic percussions weave together seamlessly, turning over new grooves to lose ourselves in. **"** 

## [Hermeto Pascoal](https://hermeto.bandcamp.com/) - Música da Lagoa

Sarah: **"** This one is from one of my favorite moments in Hermeto Pascoal's 1985 experimental film, Sinfonia do Alto Ribeira. In this session within one of the Alto Ribeira's rivers (we can hear the group blowing bubbles in the beginning), the musicians experiment with blowing bottles, filling them with varying levels of river water to create harmonies. Once the rhythm is established, Pascoal starts to solo over the bottles with his bamboo flute. He too is experimenting with the river, splashing and dunking his head under water. Rapidly restricting and freeing the flute's acoustic body this way, a natural glissando effect is created :) So much spontaneity and intricacy within these sessions, the natural world becomes both playmate and artistic collaborator. **"** 

## [Laurie Bird](https://lauriebird.bandcamp.com/album/acid-jussa-trip) - Jussa Trip

 Sarah: **"** I've been listening to this one quite a bit this week, off of a two-song EP by Laurie Bird. Another gem for synthwork textures :) **"** 

## [Rrose](https://rrose.bandcamp.com/), [POLYGONIA](https://soundcloud.com/polygonia) - Inhaler

Sarah: **"** One more mesmerizing track from [Polygonia](https://soundcloud.com/polygonia) to finish off our selection, arriving from her latest collaborative mini album with Rrose, entitled [Dermatology](https://rrose.bandcamp.com/album/dermatology). The momentum in this heart beat bass offers its own kind of gravity, anchoring us amidst Polygonia's signature layered rhythmic textures and subtle shifting -- we are both tethered and transformed. **"** 

Thank you for joining this session, that's all for this week :) A very special thank you to Noémie Dijon for this episode's beautiful illustration and to our dear guest [Polygonia](https://soundcloud.com/polygonia) for this stunning selection.

This morning we're slowly emerging. It's Sunday, the night was warm. We begin the routine of quiet days. The Mail Tape selection of the day is out. Click. And here we go! You never know what you're gonna get. Like a box of chocolates.

And today, we embark with Crenoka, for a dreamlike episode, reflecting her beautifully motley world.

It's been over a year since her album Eidolon came out, and as it often comes back to our ears, we thought it was a good reason to invite her and find out what was going on in hers. Because Crenoka is an artist made up of diverse influences, sometimes close, sometimes distant. She plays music that seems to come from another universe, just as it is also curiously familiar. A cosmic and daring Pop, which bears the traces of past adventures, like discreet memories of distant journeys, discussions, contemplations...



This is it ! Today's cuvée, made up of pieces gleaned at random from beautiful peregrinations, which we share with joy, so that you can share them in turn and so that others can share them too.

This morning, we are thrilled to have [Andrii Pokaz](https://pokaz.bandcamp.com/album/voices) bring the sunshine we all need to our speakers.

Based in Odessa, Ukraine, Andrii Pokaz is a pianist and composer who moves freely between jazz, classical, and contemporary sounds. His selection for today sparks moments of reflection, surprise, and joy, just like his latest album, [Proteus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeE_eDD467E&list=OLAK5uy_k33FcPsVguB_NOElan9oncrQZMa3WZLQY), released this summer. A boundless universe to explore as your morning unfolds.

# Andrii Pokaz's selection

## [Esbjörn Svensson Trio](https://esbjornsvenssontrio.bandcamp.com/album/strange-place-for-snow) - Serenade for the Renegade

 Andrii Pokaz: **"** This is a winter morning when you don’t need to rush and when you begin your interaction with the world very carefully. **"** 

## [Sergio Mendes](https://www.discogs.com/fr/release/12788450-The-Sergio-Mendes-Trio-In-The-Brazilian-Bag) - Let Me

Andrii Pokaz: **"** When you wake up all soaked in love and with the desire to turn this day into a fairy tale.**"** 

## [Beastie Boys](https://www.discogs.com/fr/master/20173-Beastie-Boys-Ill-Communication) - Sabrosa

 Andrii Pokaz: **"** For the morning of an active day. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Andrii Pokaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeE_eDD467E&list=OLAK5uy_k33FcPsVguB_NOElan9oncrQZMa3WZLQY) - Eclosion

 Aloyse: **"** A great force wrapped in delicacy, impossible not to be drawn in, carried into its world within seconds, even as the track shifts and transforms along the way. Simply elegant. **"** 

## [O.](https://othebanduk.bandcamp.com/album/weirdos) - 176

 Aloyse: **"** An explosive band that creates tracks you can’t help but headbang to, with crushing drums and twisted sax. It’s intense, thrilling, and awesome to experience [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr0E7gFfKOA). **"** 

## [Yttling Jazz](https://yr1.se/illegalhitlp) - Illegal Hit ([Joshua Idehen](https://joshuaidehen.bandcamp.com/) & [Saturday, Monday](https://saturdaymonday.bandcamp.com/track/fwd-lagartijeando-remix) Remake)

 Aloyse: **"** A remake from the song of Yttling Jazz's upcoming album Illegal Hit. Rhythm is the weapon ! **"** 

## [Donny McCaslin](https://donnymccaslin.bandcamp.com/album/lullaby-for-the-lost) - Celestial

 Aloyse: **"** Amazing fusion between jazz improvisation and subtle electronic waves. I love the shimmering textures and shifting rhythms, it draws you into a space that feels both intimate and infinite. **"** 

That’s all for today. Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Andrii Pokaz](https://www.instagram.com/andrii.pokaz/?hl=fr) for being our guest, and to [Camille Lemeunier](https://camillelemeunier.fr/) for the gorgeous illustration of today’s episode!

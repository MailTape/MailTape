We're back, welcome to the 24 - 25 season of MailTape ! We have a good feeling about this one :)) As always, we thank our loyal listeners for joining us for their Sunday music discoveries ! Your support through all these years means so much to us :,) 

This morning, we welcome special guest, Magana, to open the season ! Based in Los Angeles, Magana has released solo albums and works since 2016. The bassist and multi-instrumentalist also tours the world with artist Mitski. This year was a busy one for Magana, as she has released two major albums, Teeth and Dreams.  

# Magana's selection

## Gia Margaret - Body

Magana: **"**Very often these days I'm looking for music to soothe my frayed edges. This song takes snippets of a lecture from Alan Watts called "Overcome Social Anxiety" and surrounds it with beautifully simple music. It conveys just enough emotion to make me feel understood, but not to drag me in any particular direction. I think this song is more about standing still than transporting me somewhere, and I appreciate that.**"** 

## Tele Novella - Eggs in One Basket

 Magana: **"**I forget how I found this. I believe a random instagram post caught my attention, and I downloaded the record to listen to in the car. When I got to this song I just put it on repeat. It's a perfect mix of things I love: it's cheeky, fun, but sort of dark. I love the instrumentation and the vibe. I think the vocals are so great.**"** 

## Trust Fund, Ex-Vöid - animals in war

Magana: **"**Trust Fund opened for Mitski on some acoustic shows, and the first time I heard this song was live. It snagged on something in my brain and I couldn't get it out of my head. I was nervous when I went to listen to the recording because often the stripped down live version of something is not what you'll hear when they have a chance to get to the studio. But this was perfectly complementary to the live version.**"**

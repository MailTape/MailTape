We're back ! Welcome to the '24 - '25 season of MailTape -- we have a good feeling about this one :)) As always, we thank our loyal listeners for tuning into MailTape for their Sunday music discoveries ! Your support through all these years means so much to us :,) 

This morning, we welcome special guest, Magana, to open the season ! Based in Los Angeles, Magana has released solo albums and works since 2016, with her acclaimed album, Golden Tongue. The bassist and multi-instrumentalist also tours the world with artist Mitski. This year was a busy one for Magana, as she has released two major albums, Teeth and Dreams, and is working on another release already :) 

Magana's work treads from acoustic songwriting to punk folk to experimental ambient, and the artist has a particularly tuned ear for interesting sounds. In her discography, each sortie hints at the next, as she leans into techniques and sound experiments successively. Her latest album, Dreams, is a patchwork of her more acoustic singer-songwriting, but with brushes of ambient investigations and voice-overs  parsed all along the release. 

# Magana's selection

## Gia Margaret - Body

Magana: **"**Very often these days I'm looking for music to soothe my frayed edges. This song takes snippets of a lecture from Alan Watts called "Overcome Social Anxiety" and surrounds it with beautifully simple music. It conveys just enough emotion to make me feel understood, but not to drag me in any particular direction. I think this song is more about standing still than transporting me somewhere, and I appreciate that.**"** 

## Tele Novella - Eggs in One Basket

 Magana: **"**I forget how I found this. I believe a random instagram post caught my attention, and I downloaded the record to listen to in the car. When I got to this song I just put it on repeat. It's a perfect mix of things I love: it's cheeky, fun, but sort of dark. I love the instrumentation and the vibe. I think the vocals are so great.**"** 

## Trust Fund, Ex-Vöid - animals in war

Magana: **"**Trust Fund opened for Mitski on some acoustic shows, and the first time I heard this song was live. It snagged on something in my brain and I couldn't get it out of my head. I was nervous when I went to listen to the recording because often the stripped down live version of something is not what you'll hear when they have a chance to get to the studio. But this was perfectly complementary to the live version.**"** 

# MailTape's selection

## Magana - 565 Please

 Curator: **"**Reflecting on this latest album, Dreams, Magana described how she held onto several tracks "without a home" following her covid confinement recordings. They felt out of place on other projects like the Teeth release, but with Dreams, her many recordings of water, bird noises, and synthetic ambient sounds find the belonging Magana was looking for, with the space and meditation necessary to properly appreciate them. Dreams aptly features several voice-recordings of Magana's dreams compiled from a several-month period, and her spoken memories of the surreal sleep-world often open a particularly abstract and suspended feeling within the album. Experimentations with distortion and vocoder effects within the tracks also parallel our feelings of chasing the details of our dreams when we wake up, seen already in Magana's sleepy and drifting attempts to recount the evening before. In the context of this emphasis on dreams, the tracks including ambient recordings from "actual" reality take on a refreshed, otherworldly energy. 565 Please synthesizes a restaurant's queue announcement, but its rhythmic reworking and placement between dream tracks present it as part of the sleep-world. Listening to the album in transitory spaces -- especially the subway -- I found that Magana's attention to the ambient world's glossed over and disregarded sound bytes suspended everyday sounds, re-enchanting these scenes into something deserving of our intentional attention.**"**

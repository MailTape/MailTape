  This morning it’s the mist. We search in vain for a few rays of sunshine in a
  grey sky. And failing to find any, we listen to the latest MailTape selection,
  because we know that there are bound to be some bright tracks hidden there,
  likely to brighten our day and give us good reasons to smile.


  Today's weather woman is Hélène Barbier, a Montrealer who knows a thing or two about juggling melancholy and playfulness. A few days ago, she released her third, very personal album, an ode to these contrasting emotions. Emotions that stir us, as much as they make us feel alive, if only we listen. So, take a deep breath, and let's start by listening to this episode, made with lots of tenderness.

This morning it’s the mist. We search in vain for a few rays of sunshine in a grey sky. And failing to find any, we listen to the latest MailTape selection, because we know that there are bound to be some bright tracks hidden there, likely to brighten our day and give us good reasons to smile.

Today's weather woman is [Hélène Barbier](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/music), a Montrealer who knows a thing or two about juggling melancholy and playfulness. A few days ago, she released her third, very personal [album](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/album/panorama), an ode to these contrasting emotions. Emotions that stir us, as much as they make us feel alive, if only we listen. So, take a deep breath, and let's start by listening to this episode, made with lots of tenderness. 

# Hélène Barbier's selection

## [Melanie](https://melaniesafka.bandcamp.com/music) - People in the front row

 Hélène Barbier: **"** This song is perfect. The melody is simple,  harmonious and epic, and the way she sings feels so personal, like she's letting you into her world without forcing anything. I love the lyrics too , she reflects on what it feels like to be an emerging artist who doesn't quite fit in. She sings about doubt, small shows, not knowing her path, yet finding comfort and meaning in the people who listen. It's about making music for the love of it, "not for money or applause." **"** 

## [Randy Newman](https://www.randynewman.com/) – Baltimore

 Hélène Barbier: **"** This is probably the song I've listened to most over the past three years, back to back with Nina Simone's version. Melancholic, sad, but warm and intimate , it even made me google if Nina had a sister named Sandy and a little brother named Ray. The piano, the bass, everything about it just pulls at the right strings for me and keeps me hitting repeat. **"** 

## [Bilders](https://bilders.bandcamp.com/music) - Wanganui With A White Face

 Hélène Barbier: **"** I love this one because it feels raw and immediate. I first saw Bill 
Direen live at the Cropped Out festival in Louisville, Kentucky, not 
knowing who he was, and it completely blew me away. Since then, I've 
been drawn to everything he's made , he's a true "lifer," and that's 
exactly what I respect in music. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Hélène Barbier](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/music) – Water

 Anto: **"** I chose this track, which comes right at the end of [the album](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/album/panorama), because it punctuates it perfectly. There is this guitar riff as simple as it’s effective, while being both surprising and unwavering support to a voice that seems to wander randomly according to its desires. And we follow it, not quite knowing where we're going, but it's wonderful, we have unexpected moments at the end of each verse. Until that almost epic finale, where we feel like we've reached the summit of a mountain and discovered a beautiful landscape to cry on, like a ray of sunshine illuminating a tired face. Enough to allow us to remain contemplative and simply savor the moment. **"** 

## [Rozi Plain](https://roziplain.bandcamp.com/music) - Spot Thirteen

 Anto: **"** I discovered Rozi Plain in an episode of MailTape (thanks Anaïs!), and then I went to listen to the rest of her music. I fell in love, especially with this track which, despite the years, is still just as delightful for me. I almost could have added it to this selection, but I also really love her [latest album](https://roziplain.bandcamp.com/album/prize), released in 2023, and particularly the gentleness of "Spot Thirteen." The kind of cozy atmosphere that makes you feel good. Rozi Plain is my favorite herbal tea companion, the best ally for those chill, relaxing moments when I take the time to unwind and recharge. **"** 

## [Cindy Lee](https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/music) – Stone Faces

 Anto: **"** Here's a track stuck in the middle of [an album well provided](https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-jubilee) (34 tracks!). I love it for its nonchalance, its ambivalent structure, from a rhythm to another, with this thought caught red-handed, as if unexpectedly surprised when it thought it was alone. This is just an excerpt, only an excerpt, which I hope will make you want to listen to the rest of the album, a little gem of indie rock with a touch of vintage charm that delightfully explodes a whole host of silly conventions. A real treat! **"** 

## [Cate Le Bon](https://catelebon.bandcamp.com/music) – He’s leaving

 Anto: **"** I saw there was a connection between the work of Hélène Boucher and Cate Le Bon, so I'm taking the opportunity to share this little nugget that's been hanging on my MP3 player for years. A ballad just the way we like it. A truly sad song in its lyrics, but which, paradoxically, sounds a bit like a "whatever" kind of acceptance. Life is full of inevitabilities that we sometimes have to accept. Since we can't do anything about it, so be it. It doesn't prevent sadness, but it makes things a little more beautiful. That's what this song reminds me of every time I listen to it. **"** 

 That's all for today.
Thanks again to [Hélène Barbier](https://helenebarbier.bandcamp.com/music) for sharing these lovely songs. Thanks to Le Cap for the connection. And thanks to Péji for the illustration!\
See you soon for new adventures!

Welcome to this new episode of the MailTape. This morning, no guest, just windows.

Look outside, look inside, and listen to what each opening has to tell you. Each track is a window onto a different world, a fleeting glimpse of a place, a moment, or a feeling. Some are bright and welcoming, others shadowed and mysterious. Some reveal landscapes that feel familiar, others offer views you’ve never seen before.



# Curator's selection

## [Kusht](https://kusht.bandcamp.com/track/window-revolver) - Window Revolver

 Aloyse: **"** About the EP this album is from, Kusht says: "The songs reflect that feeling of being alive with friends and staying up all night to dance and talk a little nonsense." And I feel, the song really gives off that chill wandering vibe that slowly drifts into something crazier and crazier. **"** 

## [The Tissues](https://thetissues.bandcamp.com/track/rear-window) - Rear Window

 Aloyse: **"** Time to bang your head against the window, but in a good way. **"** 

## [Ceitidh Mac](https://ceitidhmac.bandcamp.com/track/window-scene) - A Window Scene

 Aloyse: **"** Ceitidh (pronounced Katie) is from Wales, and she mixes cello, singing, and electronic sounds in a really unique way. I really love her songs, they immediately put you in a mood, like a whole little scene you can see in your head. I don’t know about you, but when I listen, I can totally picture myself standing by the living room window, watching the street under the rain, feeling everything around me. **"**

Welcome to this new episode of the MailTape. This morning, no guest, just windows.

Look outside, look inside, and listen to what each opening has to tell you. Each track is a window onto a different world, a fleeting glimpse of a place, a moment, or a feeling. Some are bright and welcoming, others shadowed and mysterious. Some reveal landscapes that feel familiar, others offer views you’ve never seen before.

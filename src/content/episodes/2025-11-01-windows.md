  Today, no guest, just windows.

  Look outside, look inside, and listen to what each opening has to tell you. Each track is a window onto a different world, some are bright and welcoming, others shadowed and mysterious. Some reveal landscapes that feel familiar, others offer views you’ve never seen before.

Welcome to this new episode of the MailTape. This morning, no guest, just windows.

Look outside, look inside, and listen to what each opening has to tell you. Each track is a window onto a different world, a fleeting glimpse of a place, a moment, or a feeling. Some are bright and welcoming, others shadowed and mysterious. Some reveal landscapes that feel familiar, others offer views you’ve never seen before.



# Curator's selection

## [Kusht](https://kusht.bandcamp.com/track/window-revolver) - Window Revolver

 Aloyse: **"** About the EP this album is from, Kusht says: "The songs reflect that feeling of being alive with friends and staying up all night to dance and talk a little nonsense." And I feel, the song really gives off that chill wandering vibe that slowly drifts into something crazier and crazier. **"** 

## [The Tissues](https://thetissues.bandcamp.com/track/rear-window) - Rear Window

 Aloyse: **"** Time to bang your head against the window, but in a good way. **"** 

## [Ceitidh Mac](https://ceitidhmac.bandcamp.com/track/window-scene) - A Window Scene

 Aloyse: **"** Ceitidh (pronounced Katie) is from Wales, and she mixes cello, singing, and electronic sounds in a really unique way. I really love her songs, they immediately put you in a mood, like a whole little scene you can see in your head. I don’t know about you, but when I listen, I can totally picture myself standing by the living room window, watching the street under the rain, feeling everything around me. **"** 

## [Umarell](https://umarellobuono.bandcamp.com/track/fen-tre) - FENÊTRE

 Aloyse: **"** The name “Umarell” comes from a quirky expression in Bologna, Italy. An umarell is usually an older man who stands by construction sites, hands behind his back, watching everything that’s happening. **Incidentally**, the band Umarell is from Bologna, and I hope this whole playlist makes you feel a bit like umarells yourself, watching, noticing, and soaking it all in, just like I do. **"** 

## [Christina Ruf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-Y8c4_Mtck) - [The Other Window](https://christinaruf.bandcamp.com/album/estuary)

 Aloyse: **"** Christina Ruf is an Austrian cellist. She plays a beautiful 6‑string electric cello. Every track feels like a completely immersive soundscape, sometimes a little unsettling, dark and comforting at the same time. **"** 

## [Country Teasers](https://countryteasers.bandcamp.com/track/go-away-from-my-window) - Go Away From My Window

 Aloyse: **"** A perfect song for unlucky love: gentle, yet with a raw grain that cuts through. Melodic and dissonant at once, it captures the broken heart perfectly. **"** 

## [Upsammy](https://nousklaer.bandcamp.com/track/a-window-2)- A Window

 Aloyse: **"** I don’t know a lot about Upsammy, but I really like how she treats sound like a physical space. Her tracks are full of tiny details, textures, and layers, you can feel the environment she’s creating. It always feels like you’re moving through it, not just listening. **"** 

 Thank you for listening, and to Thibault Daumain for his amazing illustration !

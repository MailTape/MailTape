As you know, Mail Tape loves to highlight unusual artists, those who are not afraid to flirt with extravagance to propel music towards joyful and new horizons. This is the case for our guests today, a singular duo who seem to make music like a crazy chemistry professor would have fun mixing various dangerous substances, even if it means blowing everything up. And BOOM! There it is: Fulguromatic!



Our two friends have just released a truly exciting debut album, a crossroads of genres, somewhere between progressive jazz and psychedelic rock. There are only two of them, but their virtuosity counts double. Their playing is technical and well-honed, their universe sometimes absurd, often funny. In short, music that perfectly embodies the adage: "do frivolous things seriously and serious things lightly." So that's the vibe of the day, enjoy!

# Guest's selection

## King Gizzard And The Lizard Wizard - The Fourth Colour

 Fulguromatic: **"** What we love about King Gizzard is their artistic trajectory, first getting known as an excellent Garage rock band, then exploring and exploding everything they seem to love : microtonal music from eastern mediterranean traditional music, then thrash metal, then 70's folk, and polyrythmic experimentations, blending all that along the way, but rarely losing focus, and having their fans discover new styles of music through theirs. It's also beautiful to see such a solid team, that know each other since kids for some of them. **"** 

## Hiatus Kaiyote - Breathing Underwater

 Fulguromatic: **"** We both took some time to really dig their music, but the unique blend of Soul and even RnB, with a more prog/fusion approach in compositions left us no chance to not love them. The live energy is also incredible and unique. This track combines everything we love about them : the somewhat prog approach of the song's structure; Nai palm's voice! Full of soul and ideas in timbre, and the band's rythmic experimentations and brilliant arrangements. This band feels like a band, where every element is balanced by the other, and the complexity is less important than the depth. **"** 

## Dick Annegarn - La Transformation

 Fulguromatic: **"** Dick Annegarn's music appeared in Lancelot's childhood through his parents. He gradually forgot it but some melodies stayed in his head, like a distant echo from the past. With a little help from his singer sister, Annegarn's music came back into his life, while Paul discovered it with musician friends, while touring. Today we are both amazed at his music, full of surprises and beautiful lyrics, which is hard in french! While deep, his music successfully keeps a childish and light approach that we love. We currently work on a cover of this track, which will be released on a friend's label (En Attendant Records) Hopefully this year! **"** 

# Curator's selection

## Fulguromatic - The Sigh of a Whittled Grove

 Anto: **"** I discovered the duo in a caf√©, almost by chance, and I was captivated by the energy deployed, by the inventiveness and by their complicity that I find very perceptible in the sound. This song is the opening track of their album, already classified among the nuggets of 2025. It seems to me to perfectly illustrate the merry mess that the band produces. It starts very gently, as if to attract us into a shuttle on its way to explore a mysterious world where everything seems pretty and harmonious. And then suddenly it accelerates, we shiver, "but where are they taking us??". No panic, the journey will be delicious and thrilling. This was the first step, I can only advise you to continue with the rest of the album. **"** 

## Celine Dessberg - –°—ç–ª—ç–Ω–≥—ç "Selenge"

 Anto: **"** Originally from Mongolia, C√©line Dessberg offers us a ballad with the yatga, a traditional instrument similar to the zither, which seems to have some hypnotic powers. It's simple, it's sweet, it makes you want to give way to reverie, like a little break in the midst of the surrounding tumult, a breath of fresh air inspired by distant lands and offered with delicious delicacy. **"** 

## Rank-O - For Every Blow

 Anto: **"** After the break, a little vitamin shot to get back on track. The dose is provided by Rank-O, a band that plays unbridled rock, flirting with punk and pop, and exuding a carefree vibe. It's experimental, it includes some funny sounds, and above all, it gets you moving frantically. With this first track from an album released last year on Figures Libres Records, the musicians give us a determined sound that doesn't bother with traditions or customs. We love this frankness! **"** 

## Mad Curry -Music, The Reason Of Our Happiness

 Anto: **"** Back in the 70‚Äôs with a band that went somewhat unnoticed despite their undeniable avant-garde approach. As proof, you won't hear a single guitar on the ten tracks that make up their one and only album: almost sacrilege in 1971! And the result is a blend of jazz fusion and progressive rock very eccentric but perfectly digestible. Let's pay tribute to these forgotten bands, drowned at the bottom of the ocean of human artistic creation. Give the album a listen! **"** 

 That's it for today.\

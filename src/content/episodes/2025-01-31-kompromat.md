This morning... 

# Guest's selection

## Vimala Pons - Piper

KOMPROMAT: **"** Vimala is a friend and a fascinating artist. She created music for these shows and exhibitions. “Piper” comes from her exhibition "Heaven & Hell".
Vimala sing on 4 tracks on our album "Playing / Praying". She has a sensual oice and cause she is an actress she can adopted different confusing accents. **"** 

## Farah - Into Eternity

KOMPROMAT: **"** Farah is one of our favorite artist together. She always talk about god and beliefs. We’ve play this track 10 000 times together in backstage. **"** 

## D.A.F. - Als war's das letzte mal

KOMPROMAT: **"** We are both fond of DAF whose style and creativity are still relevant today. Their minimalistic and percussive sound are ageless and this album is a great source of inspiration. Obviously this song is in our backstage and tourbus playlist. **"**

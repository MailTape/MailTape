This morning... 

# Claude's selection

## Ashra - Sunrain

 Claude: **"** At the same time this song is super peaceful but also kind of anxiety provoking in my opinion, and that is why it fits with Sundays, it sounds like you are at the end and at the beginning of something, just waiting.  **"** 

## Alex G - Blessing

 Claude: **"** Super repetitive in the best sense possible, very peaceful but also aggressive for some reason. **"** 

## Ben Abraham - War In Your Arms

 Claude: **"** One of my favorite songs of all time, it’s incredibly nostalgic and the bass melody is fantastic. **"**

# MailTape's selection

## Claude - Addition

 ImaCrea: **"** Difficult to choose a title for Claude, as each one unfolds a vast universe conducive to dreamlike exploration. Claude sings doubt in an overproductive era that can no longer look at itself in the mirror because its pace is accelerating. Add more? **"** 

## Ascendant Vierge - Aimer sur le long terme

 ImaCrea: **"** I thought of this title by Ascendant Vierge, in relation to Claude's text about love. Has Mathilde found the magical formula for infinite love? I like how this title, with its dub-inspired vibe, stands out like a UFO from their latest album. A cloud of optimism that feels good; I've been listening to it every morning while biking lately, and it's incredibly refreshing. **"** 

## BRSB - Love For The Sake Of Dub

 ImaCrea: **"** Let's keep the dub vibe with BRSB... Coming from their latest album, I keep coming back to this track again and again lately. **"** 

## UTO - Unshape

 ImaCrea: **"** I discovered UTO's last wednesday at Petit Bain for their release party. Thank you Iris for the invitation! Freshly released by the great folks at Infiné Records, UTO is furiously optimistic with music infused by a love for life.

At first listen, I've got to say I thought this was a reimagining of 90's pop, evoking memories of skate videos and MTV clips flashing through my mind. But listening to the album, I understood it's much more. This band has explosive potential, and this is just the beginning.Don't be an old fart and keep dancing! **"** 

 Thank you...

This morning... 

# Claude's selection

## Ashra - Sunrain

 Claude: **"** At the same time this song is super peaceful but also kind of anxiety provoking in my opinion, and that is why it fits with Sundays, it sounds like you are at the end and at the beginning of something, just waiting.  **"** 

## Alex G - Blessing

 Claude: **"** Super repetitive in the best sense possible, very peaceful but also aggressive for some reason. **"** 

## Ben Abraham - War In Your Arms

 Claude: **"** One of my favorite songs of all time, itâ€™s incredibly nostalgic and the bass melody is fantastic. **"** 

# MailTape's selection

## [The 13th Floor Elevator](https://13thfloorelevators.bandcamp.com/music) - Roller Coaster

 Evan: **"** My song choice for a Sunday morning wake-up is Roller Coaster by the 13th Floor Elevators.         A five minute descent into madness built around a skulking guitar riff, screeching vibrato vocals          and an electric jug; is in my opinion the perfect compliment to a lazy Sunday coffee in bed. **"** 

## [This Heat](https://thisheat.bandcamp.com/) - Makeshift Swahili

 Harry: **"** More of a rediscovery for me as I’ve been getting back into the This Heat catalog and I think this song could be their best; heavy drones, bizarre screeched vocals, really angular riffs and drums -          the whole thing just sounds apocalyptic. In the second half it cuts into a noisy and destroyed-sounding live version of the same song, feels like getting whiplashed. Peak post-punk. **"** 

## Rollins Band - Low Self Opinion

 Lewis: **"** I’ve always been infatuated with Henry Rollins work, either being with Black Flag, his writing or Rollins Band. I think the grooves in Rollins Band are second to none, this track In particular displays their  relentless power and grit while still creating deep grooves and rhythms. Rollins’ lyrics are also something I’ve always been a fan of, he’s very abrasive with how he writes, always getting straight to the point with no bull shit in between. **"** 

## [BODEGA](https://bodegabk.bandcamp.com/music) - Webster Hall

 Archie: **"** I’ve always been really into what BODEGA are up to since their debut album. It’s normally their energy that really attracts me to their music, but Webster Hall is a more melancholic cut on their new record. The lyrics of this track are really what makes me enjoy it so much. **"** 



# Curator's selection

## [Wax Head](https://waxhead1.bandcamp.com/album/salt-fat-acid-heat-2) - Track

 Aloyse: **"** This is the track that introduced me to Wax Head. I was mindlessly scrolling through songs when Jobless Goblin came on and i immediately put it on repeat. I love its ultra effective psychedelic punk vibe, it makes me want to float in space while shaking my head like crazy. Wild and addictive with just the right mix of chaos and groove. It’s perfect for losing yourself for a few minutes. **"** 

## [We Took All The Acid](https://thewarlocks.bandcamp.com/album/songs-from-the-pale-eclipse-2) - The Warlocks

 Aloyse: **"** So, did you ? Whether or not that’s the case, this track feels like the perfect companion either way. Here, the energy leans more into psychedelia than punk, but it never loses its pulse. This song invites you to float in your bed without fully slipping back into sleep. The layered sounds are hypnotic, it has this weightless vibe, but the steady rhythm keeps you grounded. **"** 

## [Dead Ghosts](https://deadghosts.net/) - The Man

 Aloyse: **"** Heavy groove here. No mixed feelings, pure positivity. I love this retro vibe, and nothing says "morning" more than the flute. It still has a bit of a psychedelic vibe, but the message is clear: get up, step into the sun, and enjoy your sunday as you should ! **"** 

That’s it for this morning. Thank you for listening and much love to Evan, Harry, Lewis and Archie from Wax Head for sharing these very cool tracks. And many thanks to Marie for the awesome illustration that brings this episode to life !

This morning we're delighted to welcome Krefeld-born, Berlin-based DJ and producer [Philipp Otterbach](https://www.instagram.com/philippotterbach/) to MailTape!


# Philipp Otterbach's selection



## Water Pistol Cowboys - I’m Sorry I Was Ignoring You



Philipp: **"** I love being productive on Sunday morning and getting things done before heading over to music production for the rest of the day. This one was brought to me by beloved NVST and it has everything i need. Amazing String Work, Spoken Words.. It also fulfill my love for super short tracks which from my perspective is a masterclass in general and I am sometimes jealous about. It's also more challenging when it comes to DJ mixes. So it's an ongoing topic for my three picks. **"** 



## Motorpsycho - Trylleball (Sannan)



Philipp: **"** These 2:29 minutes by MP are part of a 2 x 10 inch Box and were written for the play "Begynnelser" (Beginnings) realized by the independent theater group De Utvalgte based on a text by Norwegian author Carl Frode Tiller. I am really into the atmosphere in combination within the shortness and the choice of instruments. One of my all time favorite live bands which I first saw live on my 18th birthday. **"**



## Mark Kramer - Ovulation Always Brings Me Down



Philipp: **"** It's so inspiring to be guest in Kramer's musical cosmos since so many years. His Solo Work, or involvement in Bongwater, ½ Half Japanese, Let it come down, Butthole Surfers or the Label Shimmy Disc even itself - impressive. We had briefly contact a while ago and I was moved that he send some lovely feedback about tracks from my album on Music from Memory. What a nice human. These 2:29 min are from the Compilation Guitarrorists released via No. 6 Records which I bought at the Birdman in NYC years ago. **"**

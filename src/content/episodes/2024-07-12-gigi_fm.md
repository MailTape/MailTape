This morning we're delighted to welcome Berlin-based DJ, producer and label boss of [Sea~rène Records](https://www.instagram.com/sea.rene_records/), [GiGi FM](https://gigifm.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape!


# GiGi FM's selection



## Ornella Vanoni - Dettagli (Detalhes)



GiGi FM: **"** I love waking up with this song, it reminds me of my parents and Sunday mornings at home. When I was little my parents used to wake me up on Sunday mornings by opening my bedroom door and playing loud music in the living room which reached my room easily! This song captures this so perfectly to me! **"** 



## Full Bloom - Giesing Underwater



GiGi FM: **"** Seriously, the whole album is just so good and I listen to the record on weekly basics ! One of my favorite and most prolific labels Illian Tape. Slow, hazy and flavourful, perfect for a morning cafe and a smoke haha. **"**



## Pepe Bradock - Burning



GiGi FM: **"** A house music classic that will literally always set you on the right vibe by the French DJ and producer Julien Auger. I love getting started on my Sunday or going from a to b on this track rather I am in transit, walking or cycling.  **"** 



# MailTape's selection



## [GiGi FM](https://gigifm.bandcamp.com/) - Gabriella



Jules: **"** It's hard to pick out a single track from <i>The Dahlem Diaries</i>, which feels like a journey into another universe. The different tracks, although produced at different times between 2020 and 2022, follow one another coherently, taking us from one emotion to another. I chose this track because it's one of the longest on the album (here is my personal preference), and because I love its mysterious, gripping atmosphere. **"** 



## [Tim Koh & Sun An](https://timkohsunan.bandcamp.com/album/salt-and-sugar-look-the-same) - Incense Holder



 Jules: **"** Another gem from [Music From Memory](https://www.musicfrommemory.com/release/8765/tim-koh-sun-an/salt-and-sugar-look-the-same)! This one is taken from <i>Salt And Sugar Look The Same</i>, the collaborative album from American multi-instrumentalist and visual artist Tim Koh and Southern California-based graphic designer, art director, and sound designer Sun An, released in June 2024. I love the strange sweetness of this track, and it's also a super-short piece that Philipp is sure to enjoy. But the 18 compositions on this album, which is a real journey, are all poignant, oscillating between joy and sadness. **"** 



## [Whatever the Weather](https://whateva.bandcamp.com/album/whatever-the-weather) - 25°c



Jules: **"** Whatever the Weather is the ambient ater ego of North London DJ and producer Loraine James, whom we'd already picked up for a [Mailtape episode](https://www.mailta.pe/323/loraine-james/) back in 2018, before she set the whole electronica world alight with her intriguing, tumultuous club and IDM universe, an expression of her inner space. As with this track which opens the eponymous album, we enter a more meditative universe, open to the outside world and focused on the contemplation of landscapes and the climate that affects them day after day. A simple, suspended setting, summed up by the track titles in degrees of temperature, which allows the artist to truly pursue his exploration of textures and sounds. **"** 



## [Duval Timothy](https://duvaltimothy.bandcamp.com/album/meeting-with-a-judas-tree) - Mutate



 Jules: **"** In this track taken from the EP <i>Meeting with a Judas Tree</i>, the multi-disciplinary artist from South London Duval Timothy incorporates nature sounds recorded while wandering around South London, walking with his mum in the hills surrounding Bath, hiking through Freetown, the hills of Spoleto, in Ghana and in Sierra Leone. This track is much longer, taking time to develop, but it's a good way to end our journey this morning. **"**  



That’s it for this morning, thank you for joining us! Much love to [GiGi FM](https://gigifm.bandcamp.com/) for her trippy and bliss selection and to Noémie Dijon for her dazzling illustration, inspired by a photography by Emotional Riots!

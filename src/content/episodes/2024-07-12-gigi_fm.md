This morning we're delighted to welcome Berlin-based DJ, producer and label boss of [Sea~rène Records](https://www.instagram.com/sea.rene_records/), [GiGi FM](https://gigifm.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape!


# GiGi FM's selection



## Ornella Vanoni - Dettagli (Detalhes)



GiGi FM: **"** I love waking up with this song, it reminds me of my parents and Sunday mornings at home. When I was little my parents used to wake me up on Sunday mornings by opening my bedroom door and playing loud music in the living room which reached my room easily! This song captures this so perfectly to me! **"** 



## Full Bloom - Giesing Underwater



GiGi FM: **"** Seriously, the whole album is just so good and I listen to the record on weekly basics ! One of my favorite and most prolific labels Illian Tape. Slow, hazy and flavourful, perfect for a morning cafe and a smoke haha. **"**



## Pepe Bradock - Deep Burnt



GiGi FM: **"** A house music classic that will literally always set you on the right vibe by the French DJ and producer Julien Auger. I love getting started on my Sunday or going from a to b on this track rather I am in transit, walking or cycling.  **"**

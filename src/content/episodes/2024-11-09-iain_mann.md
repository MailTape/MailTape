This morning... 

# Guest's selection

## The Botticellis - New Room

 Guest: **"** The opening bars of this track take my breath away every time I hear them. It's the heart-wrenching, hopeful beauty of the spiraling chord sequence, which sets up a verse that feels like a memory from a late 70s California childhood. Faded organ and guitar like an old polaroid and gorgeous, shiny vocals singing about something lost and precious. **"** 

## Thelonious Monk - Light Blue

 Guest: **"** It's an eight bar tune that loops, seeming to trip over itself. Alternating crunchy dissonances and sympathetic consonances, the tune feels like a character; benevolent, troubled, courageously honest about its own flaws. **"** 

## Carlos Hayre - Silencio

 Guest: **"** This music is from the city where I spent my childhood: Lima, Peru. It's a kind of music called marinera lime√±a, and it's party music; collective, spontaneous, built on centuries-old traditions. This recording, from the 1970s, assembled some of the best singers and instrumentalists of the genre - some of them old men by then - and had them let loose. You can hear pairs of singers alternating, taking turns, matching verses from a vast memorized repertoire. **"**

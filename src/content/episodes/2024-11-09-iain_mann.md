Should we step to the sweeter side of bittersweet, stumble in some memories and reveries ?

let's take an hour for this something special with MailTape's dear guest, Iain Mann. Based in the UK, the multi-instrumentalist connects influences psychedelic folk and rock music.   

# Guest's selection

## The Botticellis - New Room

 Iain Mann: **"** The opening bars of this track take my breath away every time I hear them. It's the heart-wrenching, hopeful beauty of the spiraling chord sequence, which sets up a verse that feels like a memory from a late 70s California childhood. Faded organ and guitar like an old polaroid and gorgeous, shiny vocals singing about something lost and precious. **"** 

## Thelonious Monk - Light Blue

 Iain Mann: **"** It's an eight bar tune that loops, seeming to trip over itself. Alternating crunchy dissonances and sympathetic consonances, the tune feels like a character; benevolent, troubled, courageously honest about its own flaws. **"** 

## Carlos Hayre - Silencio

 Iain Mann: **"** This music is from the city where I spent my childhood: Lima, Peru. It's a kind of music called marinera lime√±a, and it's party music; collective, spontaneous, built on centuries-old traditions. This recording, from the 1970s, assembled some of the best singers and instrumentalists of the genre - some of them old men by then - and had them let loose. You can hear pairs of singers alternating, taking turns, matching verses from a vast memorized repertoire. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## Iain Mann - Saya for Molly

 Curator: **"** One of my favorites off of Iain Mann's latest album, Magic Tracks. The feathering rhythm in this one is so unexpected and entrancing, Mann notes how this track has particular Andean folk and Bolivian Saya influences, connecting to his childhood. Be sure to also look out for Fugue of the Wino (Con Fuga De Wayno) when you listen through, especially for its quena/charangro/guitar outro :) **"** 

## Feed LA - Hikaye

 Curator: **"** More on interesting rhythms, this 6 kick ! **"** 

## Hayvanlar Alemi & Shhjjjjjjj - Equatorial Lies

 Curator: **"** Mesmerizing **"** 

## Nightshift - Sure Look

 Curator: **"** More of a rock moment to finish off this playlist, let's grooooove **"** 

 Thank you...

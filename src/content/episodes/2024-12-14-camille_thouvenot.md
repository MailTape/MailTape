This morning, Mail Tape invites you to revisit some classics and to
continue the discovery of artistic works from other times or that
just come out of the studios. So, whether they are new or old,
today's tracks all have in common that they have an incredible depth,
a very special ability to inspire the people who listen to some waves
of emotions that their authors have taken care to lay down fervently
on their instruments. And fervor is particularly discussed in this
episode because it's the fruit of our passion, it's what we take
pleasure in sharing with you, every Sunday!

Today, it’s Camille Thouvenot who cooks this enchanting episode with us. His [new album](https://bfan.link/intriospection) has just been released and
this is the opportunity for him to tell us more about the influences
that nourished his creation; essential songs in the form of
masterpieces that are the foundation of our common musical culture,
that inspire entire generations, past, present and future.  


# Guest's selection

## Bob Marley - Concrete Jungle

 Camille Thouvenot: **"** 
(this particular version)

Since very very
young, I have a link with Jamaican music (reggae, rocksteady and ska)
in particular. Two groups in which I officiated bear witness to this.\
From the ages of 13
to 18, I co-founded our first group with childhood friends called
"Skanda" with whom we played festive music strongly
inspired by ska and reggae, Jamaican music (Bob Marley,
Skatalites...) , English (Madness, Steel Pulse..) and French
(Sinsemilia, Babylon Circus, La Ruda, Percubaba..). It was quite
wonderful to be able to experience these things at a young age during
our first stage and studio experiences. This had a big impact on us.\
Almost ten years
after the end of Skanda, I reassembled the "Foolish Ska Jazz
Orchestra" in Lyon where I am based, to reconnect with this
music but this time by mixing it with the Jazz that I had discovered
and working for ten years.\
Currently I still
quote and play reggae phases by evoking the "skank" with my
left hand when I play the piano in my trio "Jazz". I
actually recorded the song “Concrete Jungle” on my album released
last November. **"** 

## Keith Jarrett - Whisper Not

 Camille Thouvenot: **"** 
(by Benny Golson, recorded by the trio of pianist Keith Jarrett)

Keith is a giant of
the piano, but not only that. Known worldwide for his solo album "The
Koln Concert", he led a high-flying trio for years with drummer
Jack DeJohnette and double bassist Gary Peacock.\
My father had the
(live) disc “Whisper not” in fact, in which this trio revisits
and interprets what we call jazz standards. This (double) album is
incredible for me. This music has deeply marked and inspired me.
Among other things because my first Jazz teacher Alex Clapot, at the
Nîmes conservatory, was completely fanatic of Keith Jarrett. So I
"recovered" (which means learning by heart and playing over
the music the improvisations that we hear) this song and several
others by Keith. He is one of my main influences along with of course
several other renowned pianists such as Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock
or Brad Melhdau to name just a few.\
Beyond Jarrett, it's
this composition by the legendary saxophonist Benny Golson, which has
always fascinated me and which I have been playing since I was 16, I
think. I also recorded a version of it on my latest record.\
Benny Golson has
just left us at the age of 94, after an incredible career. He marked
the history of Jazz, Peace to his soul. **"** 

## Oscar Peterson - I Remember Clifford

 Camille Thouvenot: **"** (By Benny Golson (again) performed this time by the trio of piano
giant Oscar Peterson)

The Trio (piano -
double bass - drums) is a "classic" form in jazz, most
pianists try this formula and come back and forth during their
career. I am myself in my second trio with at the moment and for 8
years the direction of the "Camille Thouvenot Mettà Trio"
with which we tour regularly and release our second album of
compositions and rearrangements. \
Anyway...\
Oscar Peterson has
sublimated this trio form time and again, he is an undisputed master
of swing and the instrument, one of the main references for any
pianist who loves jazz. Like many others, he changed the history of
this instrument in this aesthetic.\
The song "I
remember Clifford" is just sublime, a gem of composition in my
opinion. A ballad that Benny Golson wrote in the 50s (just that, I
remind you that the man has just died!)\
This piece is
dedicated to his friend at the time Clifford Brown, a genius
trumpeter, who died suddenly in a car accident. It has become an
anthem in the jazz world. And here Oscar, gives us a lyrical and
jubilant version in the sense where the tempo is doubled twice,
therefore: we start from a ballad passing through a swing medium and
bringing us to a crazy up tempo. You really have to listen to the
piece from start to finish (8 minutes of madness for me). I also
noted this song. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Camille Thouvenot Mettà Trio](https://bfan.link/intriospection) – Donkey-Run

 Anto: **"** It was in Marseille, during the finish of the Tour Alternatiba that
my ears became acquainted with the vibe of Camille Thouvenot. He was
on the keyboard to accompany MC Sirop with other very good musicians,
but we only saw him, we only heard him. The way his hands slide
across the keys is simply breathtaking. So I went to listen to what
else he was doing and the least we can say is that the man is
prolific. In addition to the project with MC Sirop of which he
notably composed ["l’adorée"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt54Cfu8RQY), he also plays double
bass with [the Foolish Jazz Orchestra](https://foolishskajazzorchestra.bandcamp.com/) and within the
excellent group [Automatic City](https://automaticcity.bandcamp.com/).\
But it's with his
own trio that we invite him today to discover a universe tinged with
jazz and reggae. Two influences which particularly resonate on this
“Donkey Run”, a song dedicated to the donkey he knew as a child
in his countryside in the south of France. A delicious groove which
allows you to take full measure of the technique of this outstanding
pianist. **"** 

## [Nala Sinephro](https://nalasinephro.bandcamp.com/album/endlessness) – Continuum 2

 Anto: **"** Three years later, the Belgian composer based in London returns with
a new album from which it's almost sacrilege to extract a simple
snippet like that, on the fly. But what a joy to find here the
delicacy and lightness seen in the first opus. Here we are on a
decidedly more ambient line where jazz intrudes in small touches,
almost with shyness, as if the virtuosity that inhabits this album
wanted to be discreet. So here is a simple extract: Continuum number
2, and we strongly invite you to take a listen to the other nine
tracks. Classic to be! **"** 

## Ménélik – Un petit rien de Jazz (prod. Jimmy Jay)

 Anto: **"** Did you say classic? Come on, we'll serve you a double dose with this
little nugget from Ménélik, an author well known in French rap for
the flagship titles he released in the mid-90s. He's supported here
by Jimmy Jay on production for a track which appears on the
compilation of "cool sessions" by the producer of the same
name, himself particularly famous for having produced MC Solaar's
first two albums "Qui sème le vent récolte le tempo" and
"Prose combat", both entered the hip-hop legend. \
What we hear there
is therefore a haunting sample of Grover Washington, sharp and
articulate lyrics, and a tone typically characteristic of nineties
rap, claiming varied influences as African as American. **"** 

## [Rouge (Madeleine Cazenave)](https://linktr.ee/rougetrio) - Louves

 Anto: **"** To close this selection, a wild song which nevertheless has a taste
for refinement. Behind this piano-double bass-drums trio, there seem
to be several worlds converging in one place. We are caught and
transported by a determined melody, which seems to want to trace a
path in a surveyed area. \
We owe this piece to
Madeleine Cazenave, pianist and composer who with her trio “Rouge”
released at the beginning of the year a contemplative album made of
colorful landscapes drawn in music as a painter would do on a canvas **"** 

 
And that's it for this Sunday.\
Thanks to Camille
Thouvenot for this beautiful walk and for the precise description of
what is important to him for the tracks that make up this playlist.
Well done to Jan Henrik for his first illustration for Mail Tape and
welcome to the team friend!

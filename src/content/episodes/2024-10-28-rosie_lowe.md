Your Sunday in all its softness :) This morning, MailTape is delighted to welcome singer Rosie Lowe for a selection of soulful, sweeping, deep listening. The London-based singer joins us following the release of her album Lover, Other. With releases marked by swells of choral patchworks, a capella avant-garde, and jazz-funk harmonies, every listen from Rosie Lowe is a mosaic to discover. Our gift to you this Sunday :) 

# Rosie Lowe's selection

## Peter Josef - Sunny Side Up

Rosie Lowe: **"**This song is the ultimate ear worm, it gets into every cell and sticks to your limbs like honey. You can tell Pete has studied the art of songwriting and this song brings harmony, song structure & arrangement together so beautifully. I love all of Pete’s music but this one is a particular favourite of mine.**"** 

## Dina Ogen - Tombola 94

Rosie Lowe: **"**This song has been on heavy rotation in our household since my friend, cellist & musician Lucy Railton shared it with me. It’s by Swedish pop band ‘Dina Ogen’ with vocals by Anna Ahnlund. I have no idea what the lyrics are saying but it exemplifies how it doesn’t matter; how so much of the feeling comes through the music, phrasing and vocal performance. I challenge you to put this on and try not to move your body. Not possible.**"** 

## Floating Points, Pharaoh Saunders, London Symphony Orchestra - Movement 6

Rosie Lowe: **"**This whole record is so calming, meditative & thought provoking. I love listening to this whilst I cook or potter around my flat and before I know it I’m in a far corner of my mind. It’s music to daydream to.**"** 

# MailTape's selection

## Rosie Lowe - Lay Me

Sarah: **"**Soulful and silky, your Sunday in all its softness. Rosie Lowe threads swift and delicate piano melodies alongside spiking jazz percussives, and as always, her special attention to choral movements cradles each release in woven webs of voices. A gorgeous listen to melt into, this track arrives from Rosie Lowe's latest album [Lover, Other](https://rosielowe.bandcamp.com/album/lover-other) :) **"**

## Equatoriale, Kingo - Hotel

Sarah: **"** Couldn't resist selecting another track from Lowe's most recent album, there's too much to adore in this release. Love the   **"**

## Rosie Lowe, Duval Timothy - Son

Sarah: **"**The namesake of Lowe's 2021 album, [Son](https://rosielowe.bandcamp.com/album/son), a collaboration with Duval Timothy. Each of these tracks fall on our ears like gifts to discover, but He Hu and Play Along are other particular favorites :) Incorporating a series of carefully curated ambient sounds, this track balances the swelling and soulful choir sections with punctures of inventive and eccentric vocal accents.**"** 

That's all for this morning ! Many thanks to Rosie Lowe for joining us and to Thibault Daumain for this episode's brilliant illustration :)

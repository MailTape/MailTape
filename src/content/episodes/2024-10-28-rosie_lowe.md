This morning... 

# Rosie Lowe's selection

## Peter Josef - Sunny Side Up

Rosie Lowe: **"**This song is the ultimate ear worm, it gets into every cell and sticks to your limbs like honey. You can tell Pete has studied the art of songwriting and this song brings harmony, song structure & arrangement together so beautifully. I love all of Pete’s music but this one is a particular favourite of mine.**"** 

## Dina Ogen - Tombola 94

Rosie Lowe: **"**This song has been on heavy rotation in our household since my friend, cellist & musician Lucy Railton shared it with me. It’s by Swedish pop band ‘Dina Ogen’ with vocals by Anna Ahnlund. I have no idea what the lyrics are saying but it exemplifies how it doesn’t matter; how so much of the feeling comes through the music, phrasing and vocal performance. I challenge you to put this on and try not to move your body. Not possible.**"** 

## Floating Points, Pharaoh Saunders, London Symphony Orchestra - Movement 6

 Rosie Lowe: **"**This whole record is so calming, meditative & thought provoking. I love listening to this whilst I cook or potter around my flat and before I know it I’m in a far corner of my mind. It’s music to daydream to.**"**

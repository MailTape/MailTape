This morning it is not easy to wake up. You struggle to get out of bed, a little too quickly, and you feel dizzy. When you look in the mirror, you're not sure if you recognise yourself, if this is reality or if you're still in a dream. Why does everything seem so complicated? What world did you wake up in, what has it done to your mind? 

These are some of the thoughts and feelings that inspired [Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/), the stage name of Russell Fitzgibbon, a well known producer, DJ, vocalist and instrumentalist on the Sydney scene, to compose his new album <i>Mentalized</i>, the first singles from which are now available and which is due for release in February 2025. Whether you're still half asleep or fully awake, let's gently immerse ourselves in his universe, out of time for a moment.


# Skeleten's selection




## D.C Cross - Magnet Club



[Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/): **"** Very first thing in the morning, especially Sunday mornings, I really need to hear something acoustic and instrumental, to remember the earth is full. This is one of my favourites from a really beautiful ambient guitar album by D.C Cross, a Sydney/Eora guitarist and composer.  **"** 



## Earthling - Morning Song



[Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/): **"** This song absolutely does what it means to. It's like if Lou Reed was from Tokyo and still half asleep. It never fails to make me smile and remember life is not about productivity.  **"**



## [Alucidnation](https://alucidnation.bandcamp.com/music) - Induce/The Secret Title



[Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/): **"** Sometimes I struggle with sweetness, but I think Sunday mornings should definitely be sweet. A DIY recording project from 2004, I stumbled across this and just loved the naivety and hope that comes through. It's almost fragile while being uplifting, which to me is a reflection of a perfect Sunday morning. **"**

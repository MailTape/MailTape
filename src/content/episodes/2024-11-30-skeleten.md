This morning it is not easy to wake up. You struggle to get out of bed, a little too quickly, and you feel dizzy. When you look in the mirror, you're not sure if you recognise yourself, if this is reality or if you're still in a dream. Why does everything seem so complicated? What world did you wake up in, what has it done to your mind? 

These are some of the thoughts and feelings that inspired [Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/), the stage name of Russell Fitzgibbon, a well known producer, DJ, vocalist and instrumentalist on the Sydney scene, to compose his new album <i>Mentalized</i>, the first singles from which are now available and which is due for release in February 2025. Whether you're still half asleep or fully awake, let's gently immerse ourselves in his universe, out of time for a moment.


# Skeleten's selection




## D.C Cross - Magnet Club



[Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/): **"** Very first thing in the morning, especially Sunday mornings, I really need to hear something acoustic and instrumental, to remember the earth is full. This is one of my favourites from a really beautiful ambient guitar album by D.C Cross, a Sydney/Eora guitarist and composer.  **"** 



## Earthling - Morning Song



[Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/): **"** This song absolutely does what it means to. It's like if Lou Reed was from Tokyo and still half asleep. It never fails to make me smile and remember life is not about productivity.  **"**



## [Alucidnation](https://alucidnation.bandcamp.com/music) - Induce/The Secret Title



[Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/): **"** Sometimes I struggle with sweetness, but I think Sunday mornings should definitely be sweet. A DIY recording project from 2004, I stumbled across this and just loved the naivety and hope that comes through. It's almost fragile while being uplifting, which to me is a reflection of a perfect Sunday morning. **"** 



# MailTape's selection



## [Skeleten](https://skeleten.bandcamp.com/) - Bodys Chorus



Jules: **"** Certainly inspired by his training as an actor, which he also puts to good use in his beautifully crafted music videos, Yassin's music creates a visual universe rich in landscapes, imaginations and emotions for the listener. This is the latest release from his EP, which is a heartfelt homage to his late mother, who passed away just before he embarked on his musical journey. Each track, with its sometimes melancholic, sometimes epic melodies, explores themes of loss, healing and remembering loved ones in a different way, painting complex emotions with atmospheric textures. **"** 



## [ddwy](https://ddwy.bandcamp.com/) - Pendorlan



 Jules: **"** This track is taken from the 6th edition of the <i>Chill Pill</i> compilation, released by the Munich-based label [Public Possession](https://publicpossession.bandcamp.com/album/chill-pill-vi), and featuring songs from various artists and friends of the label. Off the beaten path of electronic music, sometimes flirting with pop, rock or hip-hop, this compilation always delivers a relaxing experience - just what you're looking for on a Sunday morning. With this sentimental track, ddwy, the duo made up of [nangi](https://www.instagram.com/nangiiiiiiiii/) and [Inner Totality](https://www.instagram.com/innertotality/), does not disappoint. **"** 



## Total Blue - Jaguarundi



Jules: **"** Another stunning release from my definitely favourite music label, [Music From Memory](https://music-from-memory.bandcamp.com/). Total Blue is the Los Angeles based trio of Nicky Benedek, Alex Talan and Anthony Calonico. Their eponymous debut album was released in July 2024 but draws influences from 80s New Age and ambient jazz. I particularly love this track, with its rainforest rhythms and vaporwave synths. **"** 



## [Ellinor Jackson](https://soundcloud.com/ellinor-jackson) - De Se Trouver



 Jules: **"** An emotional gem of a song from Swedish music producer Ellinor Jackson. It's the kind of sound that you stumble upon while digging for hours, that you listen to with one ear, then immediately play over and over again, that you're excited to share with your music buddies, and that stays in your head for weeks. **"**  



That’s it for this morning, thank you for joining us! Much love to [Yassin Keetan](https://www.instagram.com/yassinkeetan/) for his bliss and moving selection and to [Marie Alléguède](https://mariealleguede.com/) for her sweet illustration, inspired by a photography by [Lisa Miliani](https://lisamiliani.com/)!

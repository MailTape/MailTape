This morning, we're diving into an eclectic, sometimes chaotic, sometimes ecstatic music selection with our dear guest [Basile3](https://basile3.bandcamp.com/album/43-c), who recently released his debut album *43°C* on Infine Records. Like a bouquet of flowers, it bursts with colors and joyful sensations.

In the spirit of his sound collages and experimentation, we're embarking on a swinging journey. Let's push the horizon further, open wide, and let it go.

# Guest's selection

## [Joe](https://joemakemusic.bandcamp.com/album/hek022-punters-step-out-club-scared) - Club Scared

Basile3: **"** I was listening back to all the post-dubstep, very rythmical tracks from early 10's from Uk label like Hessle Audio or Hemlock and i discovered back all the tracks from Uk producer Joe which age so well to me. They are always taking a lot of risk and are so fun, yet still kinda functionnal to play in dj sets. **"** 

## [bambino dj](https://bambinodj.bandcamp.com/album/quixotek) - Blow Of Wind

Basile3: **"** This track is very good, very delicate texture and still very rythmical to me, from a producer i don't know much about but i really like his work. It's always very cloudy, with a lot of textures and layers but still also pretty efficient as dance tracks. **"** 

## [Toxe](https://toxe.bandcamp.com/album/toxe2) - Eating Hearts

Basile3: **"** Toxe swedish producer new album is so good, quite pop and quite singular in the way things are arranged, with a lot of synths and very digital textures, it's also sung in swedish which makes it quite original to my ears. This song on the album might be the catchiest but the whole definitely worth to look into, if you're into synth music and dreamy pop. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## [Basile3](https://basile3.bandcamp.com/album/43-c) - Sirens Feat. Thelma Cappello

 ImaCrea: **"** Basile3's entire album is rich and diverse, with some tracks leaning more towards pop than others. I would define the overall experience as experimental, daring, and hopeful. I chose this particular track for its expansive ambient landscape. I wanted to highlight the depth of his music, and I felt it made a smooth transition after the previous track. **"** 

## [Machinedrum](https://machinedrum.bandcamp.com/album/3for82) - Honey

 ImaCrea: **"** I'm a big fan of Machinedrum, so you can imagine my excitement when I discovered he recently released a new album. I love how he's exploring new directions, especially in rap and hip-hop, particularly through his collaboration with Mick Jenkins. However, I chose this vibrant track to maintain the electronic vibe. "Honey" feels like paragliding over the sea under a bright blue sky. I love it. **"** 

## [Hakushi Hasegawa](https://hakushihasegawa.bandcamp.com/album/mah-gakk) - Enbami

 ImaCrea: **"** Hakushi Hasegawa's wildness is back. Dive into this chaotic soundscape, swim through the fluidity, liquefy yourself, recompose your body, and emerge rejuvenated and refreshed. **"** 

## [St. Vincent](https://stvincent.bandcamp.com/album/all-born-screaming-2) - La Fruta Mas Dulce

 ImaCrea: **"** St. Vincent is one of my favorite artists. She is incredibly powerful and creative in her music production. This track was just released, and I couldn't resist including it. Its great vibes provide superpowers, and listening to it fills me with hope, no matter how dark the surroundings may be. Finding, nurturing, and caring for our desire to live is essential to keep the light on, spread hope, and resist. **"** 

That wraps up our session for this morning! We hope you found it 
enjoyable, and as always, we appreciate you spending your Sunday with 
us. A special thanks to Noémie Dijon for the vibrant illustration

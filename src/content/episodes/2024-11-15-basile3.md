This morning... 

# Guest's selection

## Joe - Club Scared

Basile3: **"** I was listening back to all the post-dubstep, very rythmical tracks from early 10's from Uk label like Hessle Audio or Hemlock and i discovered back all the tracks from Uk producer Joe which age so well to me. They are always taking a lot of risk and are so fun, yet still kinda functionnal to play in dj sets. **"** 

## bambino dj - Blow Of Wind

Basile3: **"** This track is very good, very delicate texture and still very rythmical to me, from a producer i don't know much about but i really like his work. It's always very cloudy, with a lot of textures and layers but still also pretty efficient as dance tracks. **"** 

## Toxe - Eating Hearts

Basile3: **"** Toxe swedish producer new album is so good, quite pop and quite singular in the way things are arranged, with a lot of synths and very digital textures, it's also sung in swedish which makes it quite original to my ears. This song on the album might be the catchiest but the whole definitely worth to look into, if you're into synth music and dreamy pop. **"**

This morning, I'm excited to share a blissful and uplifting episode curated with [Laurie Torres](laurietorres.bandcamp.com). This selection invites you to step outside on a sunny day, to reawaken your eyes and spirit, and to let the beauty of the unknown amaze you. Laurie's album "*[Après Coup](https://laurietorres.bandcamp.com/album/apr-s-coup)*" has been a wonderful companion for me as I embraced the last spring season, and I hope today's MailTape will lead you to great discoveries that will enrich the soundtrack of your summer. So, let’s be excellent to each other and enjoy the journey!

# Laurie Torres' selection

## [Time Wharp](https://timewharp.bandcamp.com) - East River Dusk

Laurie Torres: **"** I love the liveliness of Time Wharp/Kaye Loggins' music. The entire album Spiro World feels full and lush, yet its energy is calming. I chose the opening track, "East River Dusk," for its beautiful arc—perfect for checking it with yourself and savoring the first moments of the day. **"** 

## [Cole Pulice](https://colepulice.bandcamp.com) - City in a City

Laurie Torres: **"** The track "City in a City," from Cole Pulice’s album Scry, fills me with a profound sense of hopefulness and fulfillment. There’s also nostalgia—the good kind—like remembering something you deeply enjoyed. The piano has a joyful bounce, and the beautiful saxophone melody is truly inviting. To me, this track is full of promise. **"** 

## [Arp](https://arpetc.bandcamp.com/track/le-palace) - Le Palace

Laurie Torres: **"** This track, from the album New Pleasures, fits perfectly into a morning listen—it urges me to go outside and explore. I’ve listened to it often on long walks, especially while visiting a new city alone. It’s energetic and playful, and it invites me to be open to my surroundings. A great kickstarter. **"** 

# ImaCrea's selection

## [Laurie Torres](https://laurietorres.bandcamp.com/album/apr-s-coup) - Clessidra

ImaCrea: **"** I can't count how many times I've listened to Laurie Torres' album "Après Coup," which accompanied me as the season changed from winter to spring. So you can imagine how difficult it was to choose a track from it. I particularly love this one for its softness and hypnotizing piano. There's an ascending energy with the choirs that captivates me. It's a soul uplifter. The way it finishes is so beautiful as well—very subtle and calm. It's a soft landing back on earth. **"** 

## [Lucien & The Kimono Orchestra](https://lucienthekimonoorchestra.bandcamp.com/album/hayaos-garden) - Le Mékong

ImaCrea: **"** Another infectious melody here sure to keep moving your soul. I rediscovered this track by Lucien's band by chance a few weeks ago. It had been quite a while since I last listened to his music; I remember Ludo invited him for our [episode 157](https://www.mailta.pe/157/lucien/) back in 2014 (11 years ago, oh my!). This track is so cinematic; it evokes images of night road trips in lost cities of nostalgia. I couldn't wait to share it with you. Go on, close your eyes and let the movie start. **"** 

## [toe](https://toe-music.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-see-the-light) - サニーボーイ・ラプソディ

ImaCrea: **"** At this point, I guess you get that I was on a hunt for blissful tracks to complete the inspiring selection curated by Laurie Torres. I was looking for this soft feeling while being energetic at the same time, also a bit of dreamy sensation. Something that opens the head and the heart. And what a surprise when I discovered toe's album ["*Now I See the Light*"](https://toe-music.bandcamp.com/album/now-i-see-the-light). This track is particularly beautiful in a way I can't describe. **"** 

## [Chicago Underground Duo](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/hyperglyph) - Click Song

ImaCrea: **"** What?! Still at home, come on let's go for a walk! Instant crush with this track by Chicago Underground Duo on their much awaited album "[Hyperglyph](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/hyperglyph)". Vibrant energy, here it is! **"**

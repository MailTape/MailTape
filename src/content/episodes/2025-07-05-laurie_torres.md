This morning... 

# Laurie Torres' selection

## [Time Wharp](https://timewharp.bandcamp.com) - East River Dusk

 Guest: **"** I love the liveliness of Time Wharp/Kaye Loggins' music. The entire album Spiro World feels full and lush, yet its energy is calming. I chose the opening track, "East River Dusk," for its beautiful arc—perfect for checking it with yourself and savoring the first moments of the day. **"** 

## [Cole Pulice](https://colepulice.bandcamp.com) - City in a City

 Guest: **"** The track "City in a City," from Cole Pulice’s album Scry, fills me with a profound sense of hopefulness and fulfillment. There’s also nostalgia—the good kind—like remembering something you deeply enjoyed. The piano has a joyful bounce, and the beautiful saxophone melody is truly inviting. To me, this track is full of promise. **"** 

## [Arp](https://arpetc.bandcamp.com/track/le-palace) - Le Palace

 Guest: **"** This track, from the album New Pleasures, fits perfectly into a morning listen—it urges me to go outside and explore. I’ve listened to it often on long walks, especially while visiting a new city alone. It’s energetic and playful, and it invites me to be open to my surroundings. A great kickstarter. **"**

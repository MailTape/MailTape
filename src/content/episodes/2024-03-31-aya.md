This Sunday, let's end the day with a walk in [Aja](https://ajasphere.bandcamp.com/)'s enchanted forest. Better known as a member of *La Femme*, she's unveiling her new promising project *AjasphÃ¨re vol. II* filled with ambient compositions drawing a utopian vegetalized world inspired by Roman gardens.

Discover a very smooth episode inviting you to unwind from the tumult of everyday life and feed your imagination with poetry and calming landscapes.

# Aja's selection

## [Albert Newton](https://albertnewton.bandcamp.com/album/twin-earth) - 16 Dimensions

Aja: **"** Albert Newton is a very good friend of mine, and I accompany him on the synthesizer on stage. I love his latest album "Twin Earth", go listen to it! ðŸ˜‰ **"**

## [Audrey Carmes](https://audreycarmes.bandcamp.com/album/quelque-chose-sest-dissip) - Micro-Macro

Aja: **"** I discovered Audrey's music at the Astropolis festival in Brest, she was playing just before me. I was touched by the delicacy and lightness of her music. It's a beautiful album perfect for a gentle Sunday morning. **"**

## [Salamanda](https://8salamanda8.bandcamp.com/album/in-parallel) - Sun Tickles

Aja: **"** I love their album Â« In Parallel Â» I stayed in Rome last winter for a residency at the Villa Medici and I loved listening to this music while sunbathing on the steps of St. Louis des FranÃ§ais. This track cheers me up. **"**

# MailTape's selection

## [Aja](https://ajasphere.bandcamp.com/) - Sceaurore (feat. Canblaster)

ImaCrea: **"** This track reminds me of the feeling I experience when walking in nature and suddenly the perception of time is changed. This *here and now* feeling, when the landscape suddenly looks different and every details shine. When one realize everything is breathing, not as an hallucination but for real, it's a simple fact one tend to forget : every living being on earth is breathing. We're all sharing that air and are interconnected with the vegetal world through that. Without plants, we simply wouldn't be here. **"**

## [Hanno Leichtmann](https://discrepant.bandcamp.com/album/outerlands) - Sunset

ImaCrea: **"** And if there's another even more crucial element we're depending on, it's the sun. Without light, no plants, and therefore no life as we know it. It's tempting to feel we're lost in space, in an infinite void. But let's not forget it's not *anywhere*. It's precisely in orbit around the sun, at a distance of about 150 million kilometers.
 **"**

## [Wellen](https://voyagefutur.bandcamp.com/album/wellen) - Kristal Riviera

ImaCrea: **"** Let's keep walking, shall we? Naturally, water comes next. I just love this track and this whole ambient album. Japanistic waves and spiritual music for dreamers and poets. **"**

## [Green-House](https://green-house.bandcamp.com/) - Ferndell Shade

ImaCrea: **"** Let's cast aside dystopia. Let's cultivate our inner landscapes and let them blossom with new desires, brimming with hope. **"**

Thank you for being with us, and many thanks to Aja for inspiring us with such calming and positive vibes. Last Friday at Le Sample for our fourth MailTape Live edition was such a pleasure; I'm still on a little cloud of joy. My gratitude to Camille CÃ©lestin for this shiny cover art.

description: Machka is Eleonore Reyes, the Franco-Colombian artistâ€™s
  electro-instrumental project that travels through melancholic ambient,
  rapid-fired broken beats and mystical trance. The composer, producer, and
  multi-instrumentalist is often fascinated by the environmental sounds of our
  world, she loves to play around with electronic components, acoustic
  compositions and field recordings to transport the listeners towards
  unexpected turns and territories.

# Aja's selection

## Albert Newton - 16 Dimensions

Aja: **"** Albert Newton is a very good friend of mine, and I accompany him on the synthesizer on stage. I love his latest album "Twin Earth", go listen to it! ðŸ˜‰ **"**

## Audrey Carme - Micro-Macro

Aja: **"** I discovered Audrey's music at the Astropolis festival in Brest, she was playing just before me. I was touched by the delicacy and lightness of her music. It's a beautiful album perfect for a gentle Sunday morning. **"**

## Salamanda - Sun Tickles

Aja: **"** I love their album Â« In Parallel Â» I stayed in Rome last winter for a residency at the Villa Medici and I loved listening to this music while sunbathing on the steps of St. Louis des FranÃ§ais. This track cheers me up. **"**

This morning, we’ve crafted a soothing episode featuring our guest Tiago Caetano. It’s the ideal soundtrack for cozying up under the covers or savoring a delightful brunch with friends. With Brazilian influences, pop elements, and a sense of lightness, it’s sure to uplift your spirits!

When I recently discovered Tiago Caetano's music, I immediately felt it was the perfect vibe to share for an episode this autumn. In these challenging times, music serves as a healer, helping us reconnect with what truly matters: love and life.

# Guest's selection

## Sessa - Gostar do Mundo

Tiago Caetano: **"** I really love the softness and lightness of Sessa's compositions. He is an artist who emphasizes tenderness and idleness. The orchestration work and the minimalist approach make me feel something very comforting. **"** 

## Ana Frango Elétrico - Insista em mim

Tiago Caetano: **"** She is an extremely talented artist from the new generation of Brazilian artists. I find that this slightly soulful and very soft track goes perfectly with her voice and her Carioca accent. **"** 

## Clube Da esquina - Um Giassol da Cor de Seu Cabelo

Tiago Caetano: **"** I rediscovered this album when I was in Brazil earlier this year. It's a great classic of Brazilian music. I deeply appreciate the soul that permeates the album, there's something almost mystical about it that I can't quite explain. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## Tiago Caetano - Constelação

 ImaCrea: **"** A walk in the sky, dancing with autumn leaves.** "** 

## Sara Não Tem Nome - Incomoda

 ImaCrea: **"** Coffee is ready, time to wake up. Sun rays come in through the window, in the middle a vase with a yellow flower. Friends around the table. **"** 

## Maria Takeuchi - Plastic Love

 ImaCrea: **"** Sudden change of rhythm, I smile and everything around shines. Got sucked into a 90's tv commercial, totally cheesy but also totally necessary. Lightness and fun after all. **"** 

## Badsista - Sem Der Tchau

 ImaCrea: **"** Sensuality from outer space. Love the work by Badsista, based in Sao Paulo.  **"**

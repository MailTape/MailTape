We are so full of joy to welcome our guest today ! This Sunday, Joshua Idehen gifts us a morning selection brimming with energy and vibrance. 

# Guest's selection

## Julia Bashmore, Sam Dew - Holding On

 Joshua Idehen: **"** A song that beckons you to the dance floor, and if there isn't one nearby... You make one where you stand. A near perfect record in my opinion. **"** 

## Stromae - papaoutai

 Joshua Idehen: **"** DID YOU KNOW Stromae is a weird anagram of Maestro? Anyway, this is an absolute storm of a track with probably the one of the best music videos I have ever seen. I've described Stromae as Kanye West but French and all of the bad bits tossed out and I stand by that description **"** 

## Fred Again, Baxter Dury - These Are My Friends

 Joshua Idehen: **"** I believe this is one of the most perfect spoken word dance tracks and had been my biggest inspirations. Lean yet impactful and that groove is just whoaaa. Love it! **"**

We are full of joy to welcome musician, spoken-word artist, and dear guest Joshua Idehen to MailTape this morning ! Based in Stockholm, he gifts us today with a Sunday selection crafted with care -- just the right mix to start the day with some dancing ;) 

Weaving creative collaboration with producer Ludvig Parment, Joshua Idehen's discography is a true delight to discover. These tracks each brim with their own life force and special momentum, balancing scenes and stories at one instant catching your breath and then at the next bringing you a laugh. Joshua Idehen describes the intrinsic music within words, rippling with hidden rhythms and tones. Speaking verses aloud, he explains that the words move under the tongue, revealing new contours  and discoveries of how they dance. Idehen's writing capturing the bouts of "now" and of joy, bringing us back to our bodies, to our friends, and to our neighbors. His albums thread connectivity, pulling us to wake from the doomscrolling and the news cycle dread, asking us to dance instead. 

Joshua Idehen joins us at the start of his tour and ahead of his upcoming album, I know you’re hurting, everyone is hurting, everyone is trying, you have got to try. We welcome him to MailTape just after the release of his latest sortie, It Always Was.

# Guest's selection

## Julia Bashmore, Sam Dew - Holding On

 Joshua Idehen: **"** A song that beckons you to the dance floor, and if there isn't one nearby... You make one where you stand. A near perfect record in my opinion. **"** 

## Stromae - papaoutai

 Joshua Idehen: **"** DID YOU KNOW Stromae is a weird anagram of Maestro? Anyway, this is an absolute storm of a track with probably the one of the best music videos I have ever seen. I've described Stromae as Kanye West but French and all of the bad bits tossed out and I stand by that description **"** 

## Fred Again, Baxter Dury - These Are My Friends

 Joshua Idehen: **"** I believe this is one of the most perfect spoken word dance tracks and had been my biggest inspirations. Lean yet impactful and that groove is just whoaaa. Love it! **"**

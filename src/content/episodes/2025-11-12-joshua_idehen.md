MailTape is full of joy to welcome dear guest Joshua Idehen this morning ! The Stockholm-based artist gifts us today with a Sunday selection crafted with care -- just the right mix to start the day with some dancing ;) Each of Idehen's sorties brim with their own special momentum, woven with poems painting scenes ready to make you laugh and brush that deeper line (the one behind your throat, the one that plunges in a line into your sternum). 

# Guest's selection

## Julia Bashmore, Sam Dew - Holding On

 Joshua Idehen: **"** A song that beckons you to the dance floor, and if there isn't one nearby... You make one where you stand. A near perfect record in my opinion. **"** 

## Stromae - papaoutai

 Joshua Idehen: **"** DID YOU KNOW Stromae is a weird anagram of Maestro? Anyway, this is an absolute storm of a track with probably the one of the best music videos I have ever seen. I've described Stromae as Kanye West but French and all of the bad bits tossed out and I stand by that description **"** 

## Fred Again, Baxter Dury - These Are My Friends

 Joshua Idehen: **"** I believe this is one of the most perfect spoken word dance tracks and had been my biggest inspirations. Lean yet impactful and that groove is just whoaaa. Love it! **"** 

# Curator's selection

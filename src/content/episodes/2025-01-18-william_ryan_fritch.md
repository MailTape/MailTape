This morning... 

# William Ryan Fritch's selection

## Mabe Fratti - Enfrente

William Ryan Fritch: **"** Mabe Fratti has been one of my very favorite artists over the last few  years. Her music is constantly inspiring.

There is an angularity, absolute command of tire, texture and feel in everything and her musical  compatriots produce. There is also a spirit of immediacy and  effervescent ease with which these haunting and immersive songs are  constructed that makes them all feel so sincere and inviting no matter how adventurous the palette she is painting with.I also loved her album *[Vidrio](https://tinangelrecords.bandcamp.com/album/vidrio)* with her band Titanic and it was far an away my most listened to album last year. **"** 

## Claire Deak - Quarrel of the senses

William Ryan Fritch: **"** Claire  and her partner Tony Dupe are two of my very favorite musicians on the  planet and two human beings that I relate to musically as much as anyone  I’ve ever met.

This album of Claire’s is amongst the most transportive and magical  instrumental records Ive ever listened to. The depth of detail in love  put into every crevice of these compositions is extraordinary. It triggers and conjures synesthetic reactions in me that Ive seldom  experienced. There is a fragrance to this music and memorable pungency to every the most seemingly beautiful and consonant moments that speaks  to how deceptively complex what she is doing really is.

Can't recommend this highly enough. **"** 

## Nala Sinephro - Continuum 1

William Ryan Fritch: **"** Of all of the amazing new transcendental jazz artists out there Nala’s work speaks to me the most. Just remarkable command of her instruments, phrasing, and world building. She has incredible restraint and  musicality that is undeniable.Fantastic album and I’m so excited to hear what music she creates next. **"** 

# Curator's selection

## William Ryan Fritch - Gravitropic

ImaCrea: **"** This tracks comes from *[Adhesion](https://williamryanfritch.bandcamp.com/album/adhesion)*, the final album from a trilogy reflecting "on the many calamitous water crises affecting life on this planet". Behind the veil of an ethereal ambient landscape, William Ryan Fritch's music is well anchored to earth. His composition are extremely sensible and bring light even to the darkest corner of the soul. I'm very glad I came across his music thanks to the second opus of this serie, *[Cohesion](https://williamryanfritch.bandcamp.com/album/cohesion)*.

Listening to this track feels to me like going for a walk. It refreshes my mind and let the spirit fly freely through the landscapes of my imagination. **"**
